MONTREAL, Nov. 15, 2017 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada is offering customers additional convenience by becoming the first Canadian airline to develop a skill for Amazon's popular voice service, Alexa. Devices with Alexa will use machine learning and artificial intelligence to respond to spoken questions about such things as fare quotes and the status of Air Canada flights. 
"Advances in innovative and new technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing have great promise to deliver more convenience for our customers," said Mark Nasr, Vice President of Loyalty and eCommerce at Air Canada. "We're thrilled to be working with artificial intelligence start-up RozieAI to launch this capability so that customers across Canada can access AC services quickly and simply, using their voice."

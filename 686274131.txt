MONTREAL, June 22, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada's newly launched uniforms have been recognized for Best Corporate Design by the UK's Professional Clothing Awards. It is the first time a North American company has been recognized in these highly regarded awards and it follows on two Image of the Year Awards received in March from the North American Association of Uniform Manufacturers and Distributors. Air Canada's new uniforms were launched earlier this year.
"This is a very welcome accolade for Air Canada's new uniform collection, now proudly being worn by our employees. We are delighted their design, which projects Air Canada's and Canadian values, is clearly making a fashion statement around the world," said Andrew Yiu, Vice President, Product at Air Canada.  "Winning a European award is gratifying as it further advances our ambition to be a Top 10 global carrier in everything we do. I thank Canadian designer Christopher Bates and Unisync for designing the new uniforms, as well as Air Canada's employees who are excellent brand ambassadors."  
The Professional Clothing Awards bring together the global professional clothing industry to recognize the international uniform supply chain and reward exceptional workwear, corporate clothing and Personal Protective Equipment.  The award was presented at a ceremony in London.

 MONTREAL, Dec. 4, 2013 /CNW Telbec/ - For the month of November, Air Canada reported a system load factor of 76.5 per cent, versus 78.1 per cent in November 2012, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points on a system-wide capacity increase of 3.3 per cent.  On this additional capacity, system traffic for November increased 1.1 per cent. Air Canada reports traffic results on a system-wide basis, including Air Canada rougeTM, which began operations on July 1, 2013, and regional airlines from which Air Canada purchases capacity. 
 "For the month of November, Air Canada reported a load factor of 76.5 per cent and an overall increase in passenger traffic. Major market segments, notably the U.S. transborder and Latin America and the Caribbean, experienced traffic growth in a month that is typically challenging for international carriers," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer. "I am pleased to see continued progress on the execution of our corporate priorities with a focus on sustained profitability. Capacity added during the month was largely at significantly lower incremental cost due to the deployment of our high-density Boeing 777s and Air Canada rouge aircraft reconfigured with more seats.  Throughout November we continued to perform well, meeting departure and flight completion goals among other operational targets. I thank our employees for taking good care of our customers and delivering them safely to their destinations."

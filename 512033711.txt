 MONTREAL, March 7, 2013 /CNW Telbec/ - For the month of February, Air Canada reported a record system load factor of 79.8 per cent, versus 76.8 per cent in February 2012, an increase of 3.0 percentage points.  System traffic decreased 0.7 per cent on a system-wide capacity decrease of 4.4 per cent. Air Canada reports traffic results on a system-wide basis, including regional airlines from which Air Canada purchases capacity. 
 "I am pleased to report a record load factor of 79.8 per cent for the month of February," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "The difference in capacity and traffic from the previous year is attributed almost entirely to the additional day of operations reported for the February 2012 leap year, making those year-over-year comparisons less meaningful.  I would like to thank our employees for their hard work taking care of customers while transporting them safely to their destinations despite the challenges of severe winter weather during the month."

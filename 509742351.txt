 New super-efficient aircraft to enter Air Canada's fleet in 2014 
 TORONTO, March 2, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Thousands of Air Canada customers, employees and suppliers are taking part today in an open house event in Toronto to kick off a year-long celebration of the airline's 75th anniversary. The centerpiece of the festivities is a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the world's newest and most modern commercial aircraft, making its inaugural visit to Canada. Air Canada has 37 firm orders plus 13 options for the Dreamliner, with first delivery of the aircraft in 2014. 
 "Today is a double celebration for Air Canada as we welcome the future, embodied by the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and take stock of our accomplishments over our 75 year history. We have built a proud tradition over three-quarters of a century by being a leader in terms of customer comfort, safety and convenience. Among the many innovations pioneered by Air Canada over our history are developments adopted by our industry over the decades: cabin pressurization, deicing techniques, smoke-free flights, the first computerized reservation system and e-services for customers, to name just a few. Today's visit by the 787 Dreamliner marks another stage of our ongoing evolution and industry leadership. We thank our customers for choosing Air Canada over the past 75 years and we look forward to serving them for the next 75 and beyond," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada. 
 In addition to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner visit, Air Canada is also marking the day with a number of events and announcements. These include: 
 Air Canada is Canada's largest domestic and international airline serving more than 180 destinations on five continents.  Canada's flag carrier is the 15th largest commercial airline in the world and in 2011 served more than 33 million customers.  Air Canada provides scheduled passenger service directly to 60 Canadian cities, 57 destinations in the United States and 63 cities in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Mexico and South America.

 Air Canada's Boeing 787 Dreamliner Fleet 
 Aircraft on order: 37 firm orders (combination of -800 and -900 series) plus 13 options make Air Canada one of the largest airline clients for the 787 Dreamliner in the Americas. 
 Delivery dates: The first seven of Air Canada's Boeing 787 aircraft are scheduled for delivery in 2014 and the remaining 30 between 2015 and 2019. 
 Network deployment: Due to its seating capacity and fuel efficiency, the 787 is ideally suited to open up new route opportunities for Air Canada on transpacific, transatlantic and Latin American markets.  Air Canada will announce its plans for deployment of the 787 at a later date. 
 Fleet renewal: Boeing 787 aircraft will replace the current Boeing 767-300ER and Airbus A330 fleets, renewing Air Canada's fleet (average age 11.6 years as at Dec. 31, 2011) with the world's most fuel efficient aircraft. 
 Fuel efficiency: Air Canada estimates fuel usage and maintenance costs for a Boeing 787 aircraft to be approximately 30 per cent less than that of the Boeing 767-300ER that it will replace.  
 Configuration:  The 787 will carry in the range of 210-290 passengers. Air Canada will announce the cabin configuration (seating plan) for its 787 aircraft at a later date. 
 Cargo capacity: The 787 provides cargo capacity of up to 17 tonnes - 55 per cent more than the 767-300ER.

MONTREAL, March 7, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced it will be launching new service to Kauai with its new mainline Boeing 737 MAX-8 fleet this winter.  The airline will also be doubling the frequency of its flights from Western Canada to Hawaii, and all flights from Western Canada to Honolulu, Maui and Kona, and other popular sun destinations will feature Air Canada's new 737 MAX aircraft.  All 737 MAX flights are now available for purchase via the Air Canada app, at aircanada.com and through travel agents.
"The introduction of the fuel-efficient Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft to our fleet has given us tremendous flexibility to strategically enhance our already extensive North American network, and offer more flights to popular destinations with more connection options from our YVR and Calgary hub airports.  With 41 weekly flights next winter to Hawaii, we're very pleased to launch new flights to Kauai, as well as double the number of flights from Western Canada and offer day-time return flight options from Honolulu and Maui to Vancouver," said Benjamin Smith, President, Passenger Airlines at Air Canada. "The new 737 MAX is the mainstay of our refreshed North American fleet, and customers are already enjoying the next generation of our onboard entertainment system, ample storage space in its generous overhead bins and the ability to stay connected during flight with wi-fi."
"Air Canada is elevating its service to Maui and the island of Hawaii and this is great news for travelers in western Canada who love escaping to two of the most spectacular settings on the planet," said George D. Szigeti, president and CEO of the Hawaii Tourism Authority. "More flights, more seats, and new aircraft with top-of-the-line comforts and amenities will enhance the enjoyment of relaxing on beautiful Maui and the majestic island of Hawaii. Plus, the new seasonal service to serene Kauai will give travelers another enticing option to enjoy Hawaii's warmth during winter. We thank Air Canada for their continued investment of confidence in the Hawaiian Islands."

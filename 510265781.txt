 MONTREAL, May 22, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that the negotiation phase preceding the arbitration with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW) has been completed. The IAMAW represents 8,600 mechanics, baggage handlers and cargo agents employed by Air Canada, and its collective agreement expired on March 31, 2011. 
 While talks were constructive and progress was made in a number of areas, the parties will now proceed to prepare their final offers for the arbitrator, Mr. Michel Picher, to consider. 
 The parties had agreed to a 10-day negotiation period in conjunction with the 90-day final offer arbitration process legislated by the federal government in the Protecting Air Service Act.    
 The negotiation phase preceding the arbitration with ACPA, the union representing the airline's pilots, has also been completed and the parties will proceed to prepare their final offers for the arbitrator, Mr. Douglas Stanley, to consider. 
 Air Canada will have no further comments relating to either arbitration process until its conclusion.

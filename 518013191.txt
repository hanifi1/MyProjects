TORONTO, July 3, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - An illegal labour disruption at Consolidated Aviation Fueling of Toronto (the sole fuel agent at Toronto Pearson) is affecting the fueling of all airlines operating at Pearson International Airport today.  Due to Consolidated's reduced operations, some delays and cancelled flights can be expected. It should be noted that this is not a labour disruption between Air Canada, the other airlines and their unions but rather between Consolidated and its union.
Air Canada is successfully minimizing impact to customers today and will continue to do so through various measures including fueling a maximum number of aircraft at other airports.  In addition, an onsite customer care team has been deployed at Pearson Airport to assist customers and facilitate rebooking if needed.

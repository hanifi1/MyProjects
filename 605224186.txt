New cities include southern hotspots San Antonio, Memphis and Savannah 
MONTREAL, Dec. 7, 2016 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced today it will launch six new non-stop U.S. services beginning Spring 2017. Three of the routes, Toronto to San Antonio, Memphis and Savannah, bring new destinations into the airline's U.S. network, while the addition of Montreal to Dallas-Fort Worth, Vancouver to Denver and the conversion of the Vancouver-Phoenix route to year-round operation, will deepen Air Canada's already industry-leading transborder schedule.
"These new routes will further solidify Air Canada's position as the leader in the Canada-U.S. transborder market and as the foreign carrier flying the most to the U.S. Apart from linking Canada's largest cities with popular U.S. destinations, these new and expanded services will also serve to channel traffic to and from our domestic and international networks through our major airport hubs, contributing to the success of our ongoing global expansion," said Benjamin Smith, President, Passenger Airlines, at Air Canada.
The new non-stop services will be operated by Air Canada Express starting in May 2017 and continue year-round, except for Toronto-Savannah, which will operate on a summer seasonal basis. All routes will be operated with regional jet aircraft with flights timed to conveniently connect with Air Canada's domestic and international schedule. All flights provide for Aeroplan accumulation and redemption, Star Alliance reciprocal benefits and, for eligible customers, priority check-in, Maple Leaf Lounge access at our hubs, priority boarding and other benefits.

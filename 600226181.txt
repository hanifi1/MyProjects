MONTRÉAL, Nov. 7, 2016 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today reported third quarter 2016 EBITDAR(1) (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rent) of $1.248 billion, the highest in its history for any quarter, compared to the previous record EBITDAR of $1.076 billion in the same quarter in 2015.  Air Canada generated record adjusted net income(1) of $821 million or $2.93 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $734 million or $2.50 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $87 million or 11.9 per cent from the same quarter in 2015.  On a GAAP basis, Air Canada reported record operating income of $896 million, an improvement of $81 million from the same quarter in 2015.  The airline also reported net income of $768 million or $2.74 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to net income of $437 million or $1.48 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. 
"I am very pleased to report record third quarter results, surpassing the previous records for EBITDAR, operating revenues, operating income and adjusted net income," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "While the global economy continued to be challenged in some respects, we managed to exceed last year's record quarter EBITDAR performance by 16 per cent, clear evidence of the success of our fleet investment strategy and the profitable expansion of our international network.  These strong results underscore the successful execution of Air Canada's strategic plan and the tremendous efforts by the entire Air Canada workforce.
"In the quarter, traffic grew by almost 19 per cent compared to the previous year's quarter, including a 27.9 per cent growth in international-to-international passengers connecting via Canada.  The transformative changes we have made in recent years provide us with the cost structure and flexibility to respond to competitive market conditions and grow profitably, as realized this summer with the launch of more than 20 international and U.S. transborder routes.  
"We continue to direct the majority of operating cash flow to finance the renewal of our fleet with more efficient aircraft and to reduce net debt levels, including with the recent completion of a $1.25 billion refinancing transaction. With our continued focus on strategic priorities, we remain on target to deliver on the key financial targets of annual EBITDAR margin, return on invested capital and leverage ratio, as well as a significant reduction in unit costs that were established at our 2015 Investor Day.  In addition, we are maintaining our priority on investments and training for our employees, contributing to higher engagement levels and improved customer service experience and scores. Air Canada's brand value has been evaluated as one of the fastest growing in Canada, and the only airline to rank among the country's top brands," concluded Mr. Rovinescu.
Third Quarter Income Statement Highlights
In the third quarter of 2016, record system passenger revenues of $4.106 billion increased $390 million or 10.5 per cent from the third quarter of 2015.  Traffic growth of 18.9 per cent reflected traffic increases in all of Air Canada's five geographic markets.  A yield decline of 7.0 per cent resulted principally from a 7.2 per cent increase in average stage length (reducing system yield by 4.0 percentage points) as well as from increased market capacity and competitive pricing affecting primarily European services.  As previously discussed, Air Canada's network strategy for sustained, profitable growth involves higher average stage lengths, an increased number of seats at, on average, lower fares in long-haul leisure markets and a higher proportional growth of international connecting traffic, all of which contributed, as expected, to the decline in yield.
In the third quarter of 2016, operating expenses of $3.555 billion increased $347 million or 11 per cent from the third quarter of 2015 on a 20.9 per cent growth in capacity.  
Air Canada's cost per available seat mile (CASM) decreased 8.3 per cent from the third quarter of 2015.  The airline's adjusted CASM(1), which excludes fuel expense, the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations® and special items, decreased 5.9 per cent from the third quarter of 2015, in line with the 5.5 to 6.5 per cent decrease projected in Air Canada's July 29, 2016 news release. 
Financial and Capital Management Highlights
At September 30, 2016, unrestricted liquidity (cash, short-term investments and undrawn lines of credit) amounted to $3.715 billion (September 30, 2015 – $3.399 billion).
At September 30, 2016, total long-term debt and finance leases (including current portion) of $6.977 billion increased $583 million from December 31, 2015.  In the first nine months of 2016, new borrowings of $1.308 billion, which were all related to aircraft financings, were partly offset by debt repayments of $461 million and the favourable impact of a stronger Canadian dollar of $259 million, as at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015, on Air Canada's foreign currency denominated debt (mainly U.S. dollars).
Adjusted net debt amounted to $6.819 billion at September 30, 2016, an increase of $528 million from December 31, 2015, which largely reflected the higher long-term debt and financial lease balances discussed above.  At September 30, 2016, the adjusted net debt to EBITDAR ratio ("leverage ratio") was 2.5, unchanged from December 31, 2015.
In the third quarter of 2016, net cash flows from operating activities of $438 million decreased by $14 million when compared to the same quarter in 2015.  The cash benefit of stronger operating income was offset by unfavourable changes in non-cash working capital balances of $209 million.  Changes in working capital included higher advance booking levels at June 30, 2016 leading into the third quarter of 2016 versus the prior year's third quarter.  Free cash flow(1) of $315 million in the third quarter of 2016 represented an increase of $429 million from the negative free cash flow of $114 million in the third quarter of 2015.  This improvement was due to a lower level of capital expenditures year-over-year.
For the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, return on invested capital (ROIC(1)) was 15.5 per cent, in line with Air Canada's annual ROIC target of 13-16 per cent (discussed below).  
Current Outlook
EBITDAR
Taking into account Air Canada's EBITDAR performance in the third quarter of 2016, for the full year 2016, Air Canada is able to narrow the range of its forecast and now expects EBITDAR to increase 6 to 8 per cent from record full year 2015 EBITDAR, as opposed to the increase of 4 to 8 per cent projected in Air Canada's July 29, 2016 news release.   
Adjusted CASM
For the fourth quarter of 2016, Air Canada expects adjusted CASM (which excludes fuel expense and the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations) to decrease 5.0 to 6.0 per cent when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.
For the full year 2016, Air Canada continues to expect adjusted CASM to decrease 2.75 to 3.75 per cent compared to the full year 2015.  If the value of the Canadian dollar during 2016 were to have remained at 2015 levels, adjusted CASM for the full year 2016 versus the full year 2015 would be projected to decrease 3.75 to 4.75 per cent.
Investor Day Targets
Air Canada is confirming that it remains on track to meet or exceed the following key financial targets: 
Air Canada also remains committed and on track to reducing CASM by 21 per cent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and fuel prices, by the end of 2018 when compared to 2012.  
Additional Guidance
For the full year 2016: 
The outlook provided constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws and is based on a number of additional assumptions and subject to a number of risks.  Please see section below entitled "Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information".
Major Assumptions
Assumptions were made by Air Canada in preparing and making forward-looking statements.  As part of its assumptions, Air Canada assumes relatively low to modest Canadian GDP growth for the period 2016 to 2018.  Air Canada also assumes a continuing relationship between the price of jet fuel and the value of the Canadian dollar whereby increases and decreases in the cost of fuel continue to be respectively associated, to some degree, with increases and decreases in the value of the Canadian dollar.  Air Canada expects that the Canadian dollar will trade, on average, at C$1.33 per U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016 and C$1.32 per U.S. dollar for the full year 2016 and that the price of jet fuel (taking the impact of fuel hedging into account) will average 60 CAD cents per litre in the fourth quarter and 54 CAD cents per litre for the full year 2016.

MONTREAL, July 12, 2017 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada was named winner in the Finance category of the 2017 Airline Strategy Awards, run by established air transport industry news and analysis provider, Flight Airline Business. The 16th annual edition of the awards was presented at a recent event in London, England.
"Along with our ongoing fleet renewal and customer service enhancements, another major success at Air Canada has been our financial rejuvenation. We have de-risked our company by lowering costs, strengthening the balance sheet and restoring our pension plan, turning a solvency deficit into a $1.9 billion surplus - all of which have been reflected in recent 10-year-highs for Air Canada shares," said Benjamin Smith, President, Passenger Airlines, who accepted the Airline Strategy Award on behalf of Air Canada.
"Our strengthened financial position has allowed us to invest more in the customer experience. This includes acquiring new Boeing 777 and 787 aircraft, expanding our international network with 11 new international routes this summer alone, and an increase to close to 45 million customers carried last year. Our efforts have also resulted in Air Canada being named the Best Airline in North America at the Skytrax World Airline Awards this summer."
In recognizing Air Canada's accomplishments, the Airline Strategy Awards said: "The turnaround reflects not only an improved business environment, but also a companywide initiative to address simultaneously several serious and inter-related financial challenges."

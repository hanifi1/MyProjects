Agreement to ensure uninterrupted Canada-U.K. air services post-Brexit
MONTREAL, Dec. 1, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that it welcomes a new air services agreement reached between Canada and the U.K. to provide for the uninterrupted continuation of air transport services after the U.K. leaves the European Union post-Brexit.
"The U.K. is Air Canada's largest single international market. This agreement is important as it provides our airline, and the 2 million Air Canada customers we carry each year between the two countries, certainty that our operations will be uninterrupted by Brexit. We applaud both governments for their foresight in making advance preparations to ensure the stability of this vital market," said Ferio Pugliese, Senior Vice President, Regional Markets and Government Relations at Air Canada.

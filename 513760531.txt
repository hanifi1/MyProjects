 MONTREAL, Feb. 18, 2014 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today welcomed the signing of an expanded Canada-Mexico Air Transport Agreement that will facilitate flying between the two countries and benefit business, travelers and shippers. 
 "Mexico is an important market for Air Canada and this expanded agreement will further strengthen air linkages between Canada and our NAFTA partner. Among other things it provides an open framework for direct flights, introduces more commercial flexibility and contains provisions for safety and security. This is an important agreement and  we encourage the federal government to take the next step to build travel and tourism between Canada and Mexico and relax visa requirements for Mexican citizens visiting Canada in order that we can derive the full benefit of this agreement," said Derek Vanstone, Vice President of Corporate Strategy, Industry and Government Affairs at Air Canada. "More generally, the agreement also accords with Air Canada's desire for liberalized air agreements with large and important markets to expand air services and access in order to provide greater choice, convenience and travel opportunities for all Canadians, whether for business or leisure."

MONTREAL, Oct. 6, 2014 /CNW Telbec/ - For the month of September, Air Canada reported a system load factor of 84.7 per cent, versus 83.2 per cent in September 2013, representing an increase of 1.5 percentage points on a system-wide capacity increase of 7.3 per cent. On this additional capacity, system wide traffic for September increased 9.2 per cent. Air Canada reports traffic results on a system-wide basis, including Air Canada rougeTM, which began operations on July 1, 2013, and regional airlines from which Air Canada purchases capacity.
"I am pleased to report traffic growth of 9.2 per cent and a load factor of 84.7 per cent for the month of September," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer. "These strong traffic results on a capacity increase of 7.3 per cent for the month are a powerful indication of the effectiveness of our commercial strategy.  Load factor of 87.2 per cent for the third quarter was a record for the quarter as we continued to execute both our international growth plan and Air Canada rouge strategy. This year's Ipsos Reid Business Traveller Survey released in September confirms that Air Canada is the preferred airline for frequent business travellers by a continuingly growing margin across the country. I would like to thank our employees for taking good care of our customers and earning their loyalty while transporting them safely to their destinations."

MONTREAL, July 3, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced it will launch daily non-stop, year-round flights between Calgary and Terrace beginning Oct. 28, 2019, which will complement the airline's five times daily flights between Vancouver and Terrace.  Air Canada is also increasing capacity on key regional routes across Western Canada this winter with its flexible fleet including continued deployment of the popular Bombardier Q-400 aircraft.
"We are very pleased to add a new route linking Northern BC with our Calgary hub this fall in response to economic growth in the Skeena Valley area.  The new daily, non-stop flights between Terrace and Calgary will not only offer convenient flight options in response to travel demand between these two respective areas, but also the choice of another hub where easy connections to and from our extensive network are available.  Further, with significant development projects underway in the Terrace-Kitimat area, we are also strategically boosting capacity on our Vancouver-Terrace route this winter with five daily flights. With these new schedule enhancements, Air Canada will offer the most flights and options to travel easily between Terrace-Kitimat and anywhere across North America and internationally," said Mark Galardo, Vice President, Network Planning at Air Canada.
"We have also increased capacity this winter in several other regional markets in Western Canada. Following the introduction of more comfortable, fuel efficient and faster Q-400 aircraft earlier this year, we will continue deploying the aircraft this winter to the BC Interior, Northern BC, Vancouver Island and Northern Alberta communities, providing more seats and optimizing the most connections between our extensive regional and global markets." 
"And finally with Air Canada's varied and flexible fleet, this fall and winter, we are also pleased to add capacity on our Whitehorse, Saskatchewan and Winnipeg routes with larger Airbus A319/A320 and CRJ-900 aircraft. Customers on these services can take advantage of our Business Class and wi-fi options," concluded Mark.
"The Airport Society is thrilled to have another route added to our business schedule. Air Canada has been a valued partner in helping us create the true regional airport. We look forward to growing with them in our region," said Terrace-Kitimat Airport Society President Gary MacCarthy.

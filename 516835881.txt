Agreement expected to generate approximately $550 million in financial value over next six years
MONTREAL, Feb. 2, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that its amended and extended capacity purchase agreement ('CPA') with Chorus Aviation Inc., parent company of Jazz Aviation LP ('Jazz'), has been concluded with all terms and conditions now met. The agreement provides both parties with greater stability and significant cost reductions through a better alignment of their interests. 
"This milestone 11-year agreement with Chorus Aviation represents another important step towards sustainable profitable growth," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada. "The agreement significantly increases our competitiveness in regional markets through lower unit costs and an improved product offering.  The resulting stronger network will support our commercial strategy of expanding internationally and increasing connecting traffic through our hubs."  
Air Canada estimates the new agreement will result in approximately $550 million in financial value over the next six years as compared to the previous CPA, of which two-thirds will be in network optimization benefits.  The remaining benefits will be spread across several cost areas. Annual benefits in 2015 are expected to increase operating income by approximately $50 million as Air Canada implements the new CPA, increasing each year throughout the following five years.The agreement also provides for long-term stability by eliminating the risks, uncertainties and set-up costs of a potential transition to alternative regional providers in 2021. Post 2020, Air Canada expects Jazz will provide competitive costs and continued high service levels.

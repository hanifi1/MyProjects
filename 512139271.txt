 Streamlined connections strengthen Toronto as preferred routing for U.S. travellers 
 MONTREAL, March 26, 2013 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada is becoming an even more attractive option for travellers connecting to the U.S. due to a simplified baggage handling process at its Toronto Lester B. Pearson International Airport hub. The new system sends checked baggage to connecting flights so connecting customers no longer have to retrieve their checked bags for U.S. customs inspection. 
 "Air Canada's Toronto Pearson hub is already recognized as a North American gateway and this simplified baggage process makes it even more attractive. It strengthens Toronto's position as a preferred routing by making transit through Pearson easier for customers who are increasingly choosing to travel our international network because it offers some of the best elapsed travel times between the U.S. and other global centres in Europe and Asia," said Ben Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Air Canada. "Air Canada has earned Skytrax ratings as North America's Best International Airline and its only Four Star international network carrier. These accomplishments, combined with other attributes such as dedicated Transborder and International Maple Leaf Lounges at Pearson featuring concierge service, our lie flat Executive First suites on board our wide-body fleet, and now this new Toronto baggage process, are all reasons why Air Canada is the best option for travel to and from North America."

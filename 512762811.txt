 MONTREAL, July 31, 2013 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced today that it will launch weekly seasonal flights between Halifax and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, beginning December 14, 2013 until the end of April, 2014. Air Canada will operate flights on Saturdays using 97-seat Embraer E190 aircraft offering a choice of Executive or Economy Class service and featuring complimentary seatback entertainment throughout the aircraft.

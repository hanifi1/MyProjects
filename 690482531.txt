MONTREAL, Aug. 9, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada Cargo has become the first airline to receive a new global certification for the safe transport of live animals. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) awarded Air Canada Cargo with the Center of Excellence for Independent Validators for Live Animals Logistics (CEIV Live Animals) Certification following successful completion of the verification process in its Montreal facility. This certification reinforces that Air Canada Cargo is operating to the highest standards in the transport of live animals, be it exotic species or household pets.

We expertly handle complex shipments, from rescued dogs, endangered animals travelling between zoos for conservation efforts and of course family pets. We are honoured to have been selected to participate in the CEIV Live Certification program and are proud of the team at Air Canada Cargo for achieving the industry's first ever certification, which reinforces our position as an industry leader," said Tim Strauss, Vice President, Cargo. 
"I want to congratulate Air Canada for their great leadership in achieving the first CEIV Live Animals certification in the world," said Nick Careen, IATA's Senior Vice President, Airport, Passenger, Cargo and Security. "Proper handling and transporting of live animals is a very important aspect of the cargo supply chain, with many unique complexities. Global standards and expertise are key to the safe and humane transportation by air of this precious cargo."

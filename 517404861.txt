Customers will be able to initiate check-in, receive notifications and more, all on their wrist
MONTREAL, March 27, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced today that it has developed an app for the recently unveiled Apple Watch that will make it even more convenient for customers on-the-go to obtain important travel information and initiate tasks such as checking-in.
"Air Canada is excited to offer customers the convenience of our new Air Canada app for Apple Watch. The app will allow customers to easily check their flight status and boarding times. They will also be able to save precious time with notifications that prompt them to check-in and board. The app further advances Air Canada's mobile strategy of innovating with the latest technology to provide customers a wide variety of options for managing their travel using their preferred personal device," said Craig Landry, Vice President of Marketing at Air Canada.
With our Glance feature, the Air Canada app for Apple Watch readily provides customers with personal and relevant information about flights departing within a 24-hour window. Essential information can be displayed on the user's Apple Watch and is frequently updated during the day of travel, including Actionable Notifications for check-in and boarding. The app also includes a hand-off feature to enable customers to begin more complex tasks, such as checking-in, that can then be completed either on an iPhone or Mac computer.

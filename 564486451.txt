MONTREAL, Jan. 7, 2016 /CNW Telbec/ - With the arrival early this morning of flight AC1999 from Amman, Jordan at Toronto's Pearson International Airport, Air Canada completed the first of five flights to be operated on behalf of the Canadian Government that will bring almost 1,500 Syrian refugees to Canada.
"By next week, Air Canada will have brought close to 1,500 Syrian refugees to Canada to make a home and start a new life," said Marcel Forget, Air Canada's Senior Vice President, Commercial Strategy, in Amman to oversee the multi-flight airlift. "It's a tremendous honour to be part of this initiative. Air Canada has a long history of participating in international humanitarian missions and we certainly intend to continue supporting our Government's Syrian refugee initiative over the coming weeks and months."

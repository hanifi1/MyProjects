MONTREAL, June 15, 2017 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced that it is a Signature Sponsor of the Invictus Games Toronto 2017 taking place this September. The event will bring together 550 competitors and their families from 17 allied nations in the only international adaptive sporting event for wounded, injured and ill active duty and veteran service members.
"Air Canada is honoured to be a Signature Sponsor of the Invictus Games Toronto 2017. These unique games inspire us all through the determination and courage of the participants, who have already contributed so much with their individual sacrifices. Our sponsorship also affirms Air Canada's longstanding support of the men and women of the Canadian military, and those of our allies, who safeguard our values and our way of life, sometimes at great personal risk," said Benjamin Smith, President, Passenger Airlines at Air Canada.
"Air Canada is a recognized leader in bringing people together. As the Invictus Games Toronto 2017 prepares to welcome 550 competitors and their friends and families from 17 nations across the world, it is only natural that a partnership with Air Canada would be an expression of that global view," said Michael Burns, CEO of the Invictus Games Toronto 2017.
Through its Invictus sponsorship, Air Canada will carry Team Canada and provide discounted travel for other teams, organizers, friends and family, torch relay participants and the Invictus Games Foundation. It will also supply concierge services and additional logistical support related to baggage, special handling of wheelchairs and cargo, and take part in other promotional activities for the games.

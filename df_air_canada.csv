Air Canada Completes Financing Transactions Raising Additional $1.23 Billion

$840 million Second Lien Secured Notes financing with proceeds of $823 million 
US$315 million Class C Pass Through Certificates, Series 2020-1 with proceeds of US$300 million ($405 million) 
A total of $5.5 billion of liquidity raised since March 13, 2020

MONTREAL, June 22, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced that it recently closed two additional financing transactions for net proceeds of $1.23 billion. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, Air Canada has raised $5.5 billion of liquidity.  
On June 22, 2020, Air Canada completed a private offering of $840 million aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Second Lien Secured Notes due 2024 (the ""2024 Notes""), which were sold at 98% of par. The 2024 Notes are secured obligations of Air Canada, secured on a second lien basis by certain real estate interests, ground service equipment, certain airport slots and gate leaseholds, and certain routes and the airport slots and gate leaseholds utilized in connection with those routes.
Earlier in June, Air Canada completed a private offering of one tranche of Class C EETCs with a combined aggregate face amount of approximately US$315 million, which were sold at 95.002% of par. The Class C tranche ranks junior to the previously issued Series 2015-1, Series 2015-2, and Series 2017-1 EETCs, and is secured by liens on the 27 aircraft financed under the Series 2015-1, Series 2015-2, and Series 2017-1 EETCs. The Class C EETCs have an interest rate of 10.500% per annum, and a final expected distribution date of July 15, 2026. 
""The fact Air Canada was able to add $1.23 billion to its liquidity with these last two transactions without utilizing any of its previously disclosed unencumbered assets leaves the airline in an excellent position to access additional funds should the need arise. Complementing these efforts have been ongoing initiatives to reduce cash burn through such measures as workforce reductions, a $1.1 billion Cost Transformation Program and capacity and network rationalization,"" said Pierre Houle, Managing Director and Treasurer of Air Canada.
In addition to these more recent financings, Air Canada also concluded the following financing transactions in 2020:

In March 2020, Air Canada drew down its US$600 million and $200 million revolving credit facilities for aggregate proceeds of $1.03 billion. 
In April 2020, Air Canada concluded a 364-day term loan in the amount of US$600 million, secured by aircraft and spare engines, for proceeds of $829 million. 
In late April 2020, Air Canada concluded a bridge financing of $788 million for 18 Airbus A220 aircraft which Air Canada expects to replace with longer-term secured financing arrangements later in 2020. 
In June 2020, Air Canada concluded an underwritten marketed public offering of 35,420,000 Class A Variable Voting Shares and/or Class B Voting Shares of the Company at a price to the public of $16.25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $575.6 million, and a concurrent marketed private placement of convertible senior unsecured notes due 2025 for aggregate proceeds of US$747.5 million ($1.01 billion).

""We entered 2020 on the doorstep of investment grade with a very strong balance sheet, low net leverage and significant liquidity, before the COVID-19 pandemic and government-imposed quarantines and border restrictions destroyed demand and depleted cash. Air Canada's strong relative position has allowed us to navigate through this crisis and we have full confidence that we will be successful in maintaining liquidity at levels more than sufficient to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities ahead. With these latest transactions Air Canada has now raised approximately $5.5 billion in 2020 and expects to end the second quarter of 2020 with at least $9 billion in liquidity,"" concluded Mr. Houle. 
Air Canada is utilizing the net proceeds from these transactions to supplement its working capital and for other general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the financings will serve to increase Air Canada's cash position, thereby allowing for additional flexibility both from an operational standpoint and in the implementation of its planned mitigation and recovery measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Air Canada's unencumbered asset pool (excluding the value of Aeroplan and Air Canada Vacations) amounts to approximately $2.5 billion at current exchange rates. Air Canada will continue to explore financing arrangements should additional liquidity be required or to refinance existing debt to push out maturities.
CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONThis news release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Such forward-looking statements may be based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements may involve, but are not limited to, comments relating to guidance, strategies, expectations, planned operations or future actions, and the Company's expectations with respect to the use of proceeds from the Offerings. Forward-looking statements are identified using terms and phrases such as ""preliminary"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""could"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""intend"", ""may"", ""plan"", ""predict"", ""project"", ""will"", ""would"", and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are based on assumptions, including those described herein and are subject to important risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements cannot be relied upon due to, amongst other things, changing external events and general uncertainties of the business. Actual results may differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below. The value of assets in Air Canada's unencumbered asset pool may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, including market and economic conditions and currency exchange rates.
Air Canada, along with the rest of the global airline industry, is facing a severe and abrupt drop in traffic and a corresponding decline in revenue as a result of the coronavirus (""COVID-19"") pandemic and the travel restrictions imposed in many countries around the world, including Canada and the United States.  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began to be felt in traffic and sales figures commencing in early March 2020. These impacts include drastic declines in earnings and cash from operations. There is very limited visibility on travel demand given government restrictions in place; these restrictions and concerns about travel due to the COVID-19 virus and passenger expectations about the need for certain precautions, such as physical distancing, are severely inhibiting demand. Air Canada cannot predict the full impact or the timing for when conditions improve, but believes that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will last at least three years. Air Canada is actively monitoring the situation and will respond as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, which will depend on a number of factors including the course of the virus, government actions, and passenger reaction, none of which can be predicted with any degree of certainty.
Other factors that may cause results to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements include those factors identified in Air Canada's public disclosure file available at www.sedar.com and, in particular, those identified in section 14 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's First Quarter 2020 MD&A and section 20 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's 2019 MD&A. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release represent Air Canada's expectations as of the date of this news release (or as of the date they are otherwise stated to be made) and are subject to change after such date. However, Air Canada disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable securities regulations.

Proxy Advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis recommend endorsing all motions
MONTREAL, June 15, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that due to social distancing requirements arising from COVID-19, it will hold its 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders virtually, online, on Thursday, June 25, 2020. The event begins at 10:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) and will be accessible only via live webcast available at https://aircanada.com/AGM.
Shareholders will be able to vote on motions, of which there are currently four before the meeting, including: the election of directors who will serve until the end of the next annual shareholder meeting; the appointment of auditors; consideration and approval, in an advisory, non-binding capacity, of Air Canada's approach to executive compensation; and a motion to renew the existing shareholder rights plan. Full details are contained in the management proxy circular, a copy of which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the company's website.
Air Canada is pleased to announce that both Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass Lewis & Co., LLC, two leading independent proxy advisory firms, have recommended that shareholders of Air Canada endorse all motions.
Shareholders will not be able to physically attend the meeting but will have an equal opportunity to participate online regardless of their geographic location. As with prior years, shareholders are able to vote ahead of the meeting by proxy using the various available channels and are encouraged to continue to vote in this manner. 
Registered shareholders and duly appointed proxyholders will be able to participate, submit questions and vote at the meeting online, provided they follow the registration instructions set out in the management proxy circular. Shareholders may otherwise attend the meeting as guests, but guests will not be able to vote or ask questions at the meeting.

/NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES/
MONTREAL, June 2, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada (TSX: AC) (the ""Company"") today announced the closing of its previously announced underwritten marketed public offering of 35,420,000 Class A Variable Voting Shares and/or Class B Voting Shares of the Company (""Shares"") at a price to the public of C$16.25 per Share (the ""Share Offering""), for aggregate gross proceeds of C$575,575,000, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their over-allotment option to purchase up to 4,620,000 Shares for additional gross proceeds of C$75,075,000, and its concurrent marketed private placement of convertible senior unsecured notes due 2025 (""Convertible Notes"") for aggregate gross proceeds of US$747,500,000 (or C$1,018,842,5001) (the ""Convertible Notes Offering"" and together with the Share Offering, the ""Offerings""), which includes the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their over-allotment option to purchase up to US$97,500,000 (or C$132,892,5001) principal amount of Convertible Notes.
The Company will use the net proceeds from the Offerings to supplement the Company's working capital and other general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the Offerings will serve to increase Air Canada's cash position, thereby allowing for additional flexibility both from an operational standpoint and in the implementation of its planned mitigation and recovery measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Coming into 2020, Air Canada enjoyed a very strong liquidity position, before the COVID-19 pandemic and government-imposed quarantines and border restrictions destroyed demand and depleted cash. This important financing will allow us to keep our strong relative position and better manage debt leverage and risk as government restrictions are lifted and the market recovers. The positive reaction from the public markets is a strong endorsement of the strength of our franchise,"" said Michael Rousseau, Deputy Chief Executive Officer & Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
The Shares offered in the Share Offering and the Convertible Notes and Class A Variable Voting Shares and/or Class B Voting Shares of the Company issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act""), or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the rules promulgated thereunder and applicable state securities laws. 
TD Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Canada Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Canada Inc. acted as active bookrunners for the Share Offering. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, TD Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Canada Inc. acted as active bookrunners for the Convertible Notes Offering.
CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONThis news release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Such forward-looking statements may be based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements may involve, but are not limited to, comments relating to guidance, strategies, expectations, planned operations or future actions, and the Company's expectations with respect to the use of proceeds from the Offerings. Forward-looking statements are identified using terms and phrases such as ""preliminary"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""could"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""intend"", ""may"", ""plan"", ""predict"", ""project"", ""will"", ""would"", and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are based on assumptions, including those described herein and are subject to important risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements cannot be relied upon due to, amongst other things, changing external events and general uncertainties of the business. Actual results may differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below.
Air Canada, along with the rest of the global airline industry, is facing a severe and abrupt drop in traffic and a corresponding decline in revenue as a result of the coronavirus (""COVID-19"") pandemic and the travel restrictions imposed in many countries around the world, including Canada and the United States.  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began to be felt in traffic and sales figures commencing in early March 2020. These impacts include drastic declines in earnings and cash from operations. There is very limited visibility on travel demand given government restrictions in place; these restrictions and concerns about travel due to the COVID-19 virus and passenger expectations about the need for certain precautions, such as physical distancing, are severely inhibiting demand. Air Canada cannot predict the full impact or the timing for when conditions improve, but believes that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will last at least three years. Air Canada is actively monitoring the situation and will respond as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, which will depend on a number of factors including the course of the virus, government actions, and passenger reaction, none of which can be predicted with any degree of certainty.
Other factors that may cause results to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements include those factors identified in Air Canada's public disclosure file available at www.sedar.com and, in particular, those identified in section 14 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's First Quarter 2020 MD&A and section 20 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's 2019 MD&A. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release represent Air Canada's expectations as of the date of this news release (or as of the date they are otherwise stated to be made) and are subject to change after such date. However, Air Canada disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable securities regulations.

/NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES/
MONTREAL, May 28, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada (TSX: AC) (the ""Company"") today announced that it has priced both its previously announced underwritten marketed public offering of 30,800,000 Class A Variable Voting Shares and/or Class B Voting Shares of the Company (""Shares"") at a price to the public of C$16.25 per Share (the ""Share Offering""), for aggregate gross proceeds of C$500,500,000 and its concurrent marketed private placement of convertible senior unsecured notes due 2025 (""Convertible Notes"") for aggregate gross proceeds of US$650,000,000 (the ""Convertible Notes Offering"" and together with the Share Offering, the ""Offerings"").
The Convertible Notes will bear interest semi-annually in arrears at a rate of 4.000% per annum and will mature on July 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The initial conversion rate of the Convertible Notes is 65.1337 Shares per US$1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, or an initial conversion price of approximately US$15.35 per Share. The Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, Class A Variable Voting Shares and/or Class B Voting Shares of the Company or a combination thereof, at the Company's election.
The Company has granted the underwriters of the Share Offering an option to purchase up to an additional 15% of the Shares in the Share Offering, exercisable in whole or in part at any time until 30 days after closing of the Share Offering, and has granted the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes Offering an option to purchase up to an additional 15% of the Convertible Notes in the Convertible Notes Offering, exercisable in whole or in part at any time until 13 days after closing of the Convertible Notes Offering. 
The Offerings are expected to close on or about June 2, 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.
The Company will use the net proceeds from the Offerings to supplement the Company's working capital and other general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the Offerings will serve to increase Air Canada's cash position, thereby allowing for additional flexibility both from an operational standpoint and in the implementation of its planned mitigation and recovery measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Shares offered in the Share Offering are being offered by way of a short-form prospectus in all provinces and territories of Canada and may also be offered in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act"").
The Convertible Notes offered in the Convertible Notes Offering are being offered on a private placement basis and are not being offered by way of a prospectus in Canada. 
The Shares offered in the Share Offering and the Convertible Notes and Class A Variable Voting Shares and/or Class B Voting Shares of the Company issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the rules promulgated thereunder and applicable state securities laws. The Convertible Notes are offered to accredited investors in Canada and to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act.
TD Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Canada Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Canada Inc. are acting as active bookrunners for the Share Offering. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, TD Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Canada Inc. are acting as active bookrunners for the Convertible Notes Offering.
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Shares or the Convertible Notes or any other securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in the United States or in any other jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration and qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction. The Convertible Notes Offering may be made only by means of an offering memorandum.
Copies of the final short-form prospectus relating to the Share Offering, when available, may be obtained from TD Securities Inc., TD Tower, 9th Floor, 66 Wellington Street West, Toronto, Ontario, M5K 1A2 (e-mail: [email protected]) or J.P. Morgan Securities Canada Inc., Suite 4500, TD Bank Tower, 66 Wellington Street West, Toronto, ON M5K 1E7 or by telephone: Canada Sales 416-981-9233. A copy of the final short-form prospectus, when available, can also be obtained under Air Canada's corporate profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. There will not be any sale or any acceptance of an offer to buy the Shares until a receipt for the final short-form prospectus has been issued.
Class B Voting Shares of Air Canada may only be owned and controlled by Canadians. Any Class B Voting Share owned or controlled by a person who is not a Canadian is automatically converted to a Class A Variable Voting Share. Class A Variable Voting Shares may only be owned or controlled by persons who are not Canadians. Therefore, any Class A Variable Voting Share owned and controlled by a person who is a Canadian is automatically converted to a Class B Voting Share. Purchasers of the Shares who are Canadians will receive Class B Voting Shares. Purchasers of the Shares who are not Canadians will receive Class A Variable Voting Shares. The term ""Canadian"" is defined under subsection 55(1) of the Canada Transportation Act (Canada), as amended, as ""(a) a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Canada), (b) a government in Canada or an agent or mandatary of such a government or (c) a corporation or entity that is incorporated or formed under the laws of Canada or a province, that is controlled in fact by Canadians and of which at least 51% of the voting interests are owned and controlled by Canadians and where (i) no more than 25% of the voting interests are owned directly or indirectly by any single non-Canadian, either individually or in affiliation with another person, and (ii) no more than 25% of the voting interests are owned directly or indirectly by one or more non-Canadians authorized to provide an air service in any jurisdiction, either individually or in affiliation with another person"".
CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This news release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Such forward-looking statements may be based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements may involve, but are not limited to, comments relating to guidance, strategies, expectations, planned operations or future actions, the Company's expectations with respect to the completion of the Offerings and the expected use of proceeds therefrom. Forward-looking statements are identified using terms and phrases such as ""preliminary"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""could"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""intend"", ""may"", ""plan"", ""predict"", ""project"", ""will"", ""would"", and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are based on assumptions, including those described herein and are subject to important risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements cannot be relied upon due to, amongst other things, changing external events and general uncertainties of the business. Actual results may differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below.
Air Canada, along with the rest of the global airline industry, is facing a severe and abrupt drop in traffic and a corresponding decline in revenue as a result of the coronavirus (""COVID-19"") pandemic and the travel restrictions imposed in many countries around the world, including Canada and the United States. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began to be felt in traffic and sales figures commencing in early March 2020. These impacts include drastic declines in earnings and cash from operations. There is very limited visibility on travel demand given government restrictions in place; these restrictions and concerns about travel due to the COVID-19 virus and passenger expectations about the need for certain precautions, such as physical distancing, are severely inhibiting demand. Air Canada cannot predict the full impact or the timing for when conditions improve, but believes that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will last at least three years. Air Canada is actively monitoring the situation and will respond as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, which will depend on a number of factors including the course of the virus, government actions, and passenger reaction, none of which can be predicted with any degree of certainty.
Other factors that may cause results to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements include those factors identified in Air Canada's public disclosure file available at www.sedar.com and, in particular, those identified in section 14 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's First Quarter 2020 MD&A and section 20 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's 2019 MD&A. Readers cannot be assured that the Offerings described above will be completed on the terms described above, or at all. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release represent Air Canada's expectations as of the date of this news release (or as of the date they are otherwise stated to be made) and are subject to change after such date. However, Air Canada disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable securities regulations.

/NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES/
MONTREAL, May 26, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada (TSX: AC) (the ""Company"") today announced that it has commenced a marketed public offering of Class A Variable Voting Shares and/or Class B Voting Shares of the Company (""Shares"") for gross proceeds of approximately C$500 million (the ""Share Offering"") and a concurrent marketed private placement of convertible senior unsecured notes (""Convertible Notes"") for gross proceeds of approximately US$400 million (the ""Convertible Notes Offering"" and together with the Share Offering, the ""Offerings"").
The Company intends to grant the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 15% of the Shares in the Share Offering, exercisable in whole or in part at any time until 30 days after closing of the Share Offering and up to an additional 15% of the Convertible Notes in the Convertible Notes Offering, exercisable in whole or in part at any time until 13 days after closing of the Convertible Notes Offering. 
The Share Offering will be priced in the context of the market with the price and other final terms to be determined at the time of entering into an underwriting agreement for the Share Offering. 
The Convertible Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears and will mature on July 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, Class A Variable Voting Shares and/or Class B Voting Shares of the Company or a combination thereof, at the Company's election. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the Convertible Notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the Convertible Notes Offering.
Completion of the Offerings will be subject to various conditions, including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offerings to supplement the Company's working capital and other general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the Offerings will serve to increase Air Canada's cash position, thereby allowing for additional flexibility both from an operational standpoint and in the implementation of its planned mitigation and recovery measures in response to the COVD-19 pandemic.
TD Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Canada Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Canada Inc. are acting as joint active book-running managers for the Share Offering and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, TD Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Canada Inc. are acting as joint active book-running managers for the Convertible Notes Offering.
The Shares offered in the Share Offering will be offered by way of a short-form prospectus in all provinces and territories of Canada and may also be offered in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act"").
The Convertible Notes offered in the Convertible Notes Offering will be offered on a private placement basis and will not be offered by way of a prospectus in Canada. The Shares offered in the Share Offering and the Convertible Notes and Class A Variable Voting Shares and/or Class B Voting Shares of the Company issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the rules promulgated thereunder and applicable state securities laws. The Convertible Notes will be offered to accredited investors in Canada and to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act.
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Shares or the Convertible Notes or any other securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in the United States or in any other jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration and qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction. The Convertible Notes Offering may be made only by means of an offering memorandum.
A preliminary short-form prospectus containing important information relating to the Shares has been filed with securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces and territories of Canada. The preliminary short-form prospectus is subject to completion or amendment. Copies of the preliminary short-form prospectus may be obtained from TD Securities Inc., TD Tower, 9th Floor, 66 Wellington Street West, Toronto, Ontario, M5K 1A2 (e-mail: [email protected]) or J.P. Morgan Securities Canada Inc., Suite 4500, TD Bank Tower, 66 Wellington Street West, Toronto, ON M5K 1E7 or by telephone: Canada Sales 416-981-9233. A copy of the preliminary short-form prospectus can also be obtained under Air Canada's corporate profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. There will not be any sale or any acceptance of an offer to buy the Shares until a receipt for the final short-form prospectus have been issued.
Class B Voting Shares of Air Canada may only be owned and controlled by Canadians. Any Class B Voting Share owned or controlled by a person who is not a Canadian is automatically converted to a Class A Variable Voting Share. Class A Variable Voting Shares may only be owned or controlled by persons who are not Canadians. Therefore, any Class A Variable Voting Share owned and controlled by a person who is a Canadian is automatically converted to a Class B Voting Share. Purchasers of the Shares who are Canadians will receive Class B Voting Shares. Purchasers of the Shares who are not Canadians will receive Class A Variable Voting Shares. The term ""Canadian"" is defined under subsection 55(1) of the Canada Transportation Act (Canada), as amended, as ""(a) a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Canada), (b) a government in Canada or an agent or mandatary of such a government or (c) a corporation or entity that is incorporated or formed under the laws of Canada or a province, that is controlled in fact by Canadians and of which at least 51% of the voting interests are owned and controlled by Canadians and where (i) no more than 25% of the voting interests are owned directly or indirectly by any single non-Canadian, either individually or in affiliation with another person, and (ii) no more than 25% of the voting interests are owned directly or indirectly by one or more non-Canadians authorized to provide an air service in any jurisdiction, either individually or in affiliation with another person"".
CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This news release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Such forward-looking statements may be based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements may involve, but are not limited to, comments relating to guidance, strategies, expectations, planned operations or future actions, the Company's expectations with respect to the form and terms of the Offerings and the expected use of proceeds therefrom. Forward-looking statements are identified using terms and phrases such as ""preliminary"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""could"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""intend"", ""may"", ""plan"", ""predict"", ""project"", ""will"", ""would"", and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are based on assumptions, including those described herein and are subject to important risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements cannot be relied upon due to, amongst other things, changing external events and general uncertainties of the business. Actual results may differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below.
Air Canada, along with the rest of the global airline industry, is facing a severe and abrupt drop in traffic and a corresponding decline in revenue as a result of the coronavirus (""COVID-19"") pandemic and the travel restrictions imposed in many countries around the world, including Canada and the United States. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began to be felt in traffic and sales figures commencing in early March 2020. These impacts include drastic declines in earnings and cash from operations. There is very limited visibility on travel demand given government restrictions in place; these restrictions and concerns about travel due to the COVID-19 virus and passenger expectations about the need for certain precautions, such as physical distancing, are severely inhibiting demand. Air Canada cannot predict the full impact or the timing for when conditions improve, but believes that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will last at least three years. Air Canada is actively monitoring the situation and will respond as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, which will depend on a number of factors including the course of the virus, government actions, and passenger reaction, none of which can be predicted with any degree of certainty.
Other factors that may cause results to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements include those factors identified in Air Canada's public disclosure file available at www.sedar.com and, in particular, those identified in section 14 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's First Quarter 2020 MD&A and section 20 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's 2019 MD&A. Readers cannot be assured that the Offerings described above will be completed on the terms described above, or at all. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release represent Air Canada's expectations as of the date of this news release (or as of the date they are otherwise stated to be made) and are subject to change after such date. However, Air Canada disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable securities regulations.

New summer schedule includes nearly 100 destinations in Canada, the U.S. and worldwide 
Options for new, fully-transferable voucher or Aeroplan Miles with 65% bonus starting June 1 mean more choices and flexibility for rebooking flights should travel plans change 
Air Canada CleanCare+ biosecurity program offers greater protection from COVID-19 during all stages of the journey

MONTREAL, May 22, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada is offering customers a choice of nearly 100 destinations in Canada, the U.S. and around the world with an abridged schedule this summer. To ensure customers can book with confidence, the airline has implemented the Air Canada CleanCare+ biosecurity program and is introducing new cancellation options retroactive to March 1, 2020, to give customers greater flexibility and choice should their travel plans change for any reason.   
""Air Canada has put in place an abridged summer schedule offering a choice of nearly 100 destinations across Canada, in the U.S. and internationally. As we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, during which as much as 95 per cent of our flights stopped operating and which has left us flying to less than half last year's destinations, our customers are expressing their eagerness to travel,  where it is safe to do so. We are accordingly gradually opening for sale flights for the summer and beyond as we rebuild our network, leveraging our strong position as a global airline. Air Canada is ready for take-off, and we look forward to welcoming our customers onboard,"" said Lucie Guillemette, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Air Canada.
""While the world is making great progress against COVID-19, we know we must remain vigilant, which includes being flexible. This is why we are introducing two new solutions for customers should their travel plans change. In addition to our regular goodwill policies, starting June 1 we will offer customers the choice of a travel voucher with no expiry date that is fully transferable or to convert their booking into Aeroplan Miles and get an additional 65% bonus miles. Both options, retroactive to March 1, give customers greater confidence and flexibility to plan and book travel with Air Canada,"" said Ms. Guillemette.
""Finally, to further ensure the safety of our customers and employees, we have introduced Air Canada CleanCare+, a comprehensive biosecurity program to reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19. Air Canada CleanCare+ works through multi-layered measures that limit unnecessary interactions, require the use of personal protective equipment and employ state-of-the-art cleaning techniques onboard our aircraft. We have further committed to adopt new strategies and technologies as they become available.""
Summer Schedule
Due to COVID-19, Air Canada has had to abridge its selling schedule for summer 2020, with 97 destinations down from 220 last year, which nonetheless offers wide opportunities for travel and connectivity. Within Canada, the schedule will increase from 34 routes in May to 58 routes in June, with more routes added in August and September.  Air Canada has also updated its schedule until the end of July with resumption of some services to the U.S., Caribbean, South American, European and Pacific markets.
As part of the new schedule, in accordance with provisions for air travel to the U.S. for Canadians, Air Canada will resume service to the U.S. on May 22, with six destinations being served by May 25, including New York-LaGuardia, Washington-Dulles, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Chicago. This is a reduction from 53 U.S. destinations served last year. There are tentative plans to resume more U.S. service as of June 22, pending regulatory changes and demand. For information on travel to the U.S. please see https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1596?language=en_US
Internationally, Air Canada will continue to operate from its major hubs to key global destinations in June. This includes service from Toronto to Frankfurt, London, Zurich, Tokyo and Tel Aviv; from Montreal to Frankfurt, London, Paris and Brussels; and from Vancouver to London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Seoul. 
International services will expand further starting in June and early July, including: Montreal to Athens, Rome, Geneva; Toronto to Munich, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Rome and Athens; Calgary to Frankfurt; and, subject to government approval, Vancouver to Shanghai. 
Flexible Booking and Cancellation Policies
Under a revised goodwill policy, new bookings made up to June 30, 2020 can be changed without fees for original travel between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021.
In cases where Air Canada cancels flights due to COVID-19, customers with refundable tickets will continue to have the option of refunds. Since January 1, 2020, Air Canada has refunded nearly $1 billion to customers.  Both customers with refundable and non-refundable tickets will have two new options to choose from:

An Air Canada Travel Voucher for the remaining value of their ticket that has no expiry date, is fully transferable and retains any residual value or; 
The ability to convert the remaining value of their ticket into Aeroplan Miles, with 65 per cent more value versus the normal rate for buying Miles.

For voluntary changes, customers with refundable tickets will continue to have the option of refunds or the above new options. For Air Canada customers with non-refundable tickets making voluntary changes on tickets issued up to June 30, 2020, with an original travel date between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 inclusive, they have the option to choose from the two above new options of an Air Canada Travel Voucher or Aeroplan Miles.
The new goodwill policies and cancellation options are retroactive for customers with original travel between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021. Customers whose flights have been cancelled due to the impacts of COVID-19 and who have already received travel credit valid for 24 months, will be able to select one of the applicable options depending on their fare at aircanada.com beginning June 15, 2020. Customers with Aeroplan Flight Rewards can continue to cancel their redemption bookings free of charge through June 30, 2020. 
For more information on Air Canada's pandemic response, including information about Air Canada ClearCare+ and its revised summer schedule and goodwill policies, please see aircanada.com/readyfortakeoff.

Air Canada offers Customers a Sneak Peek at Improvements Coming with the New Aeroplan Program

Français











News provided by

Aeroplan



May 07, 2020, 12:34 ET



Share this article















































All members can now bid for cabin upgrades using their Aeroplan Miles 
All members can now buy and gift Aeroplan Miles with ease, at any time 
New buy miles feature highlighted in Travel at Home special introductory promotion 
A portion of all the sales proceeds will support leading mental health and addiction organization

MONTREAL, May 7, 2020 /CNW/ - Air Canada has introduced two new Aeroplan features in advance of the re-launch of its loyalty program later this year. Members can buy or gift miles at any time and can now use Aeroplan Miles to bid on cabin seating upgrades on Air Canada flights. 
""Like all Canadians, we remain deeply concerned about these unprecedented times and the effects on our health and economy. Yet, we continue to plan for a time when we can safely welcome all customers back in the skies.  Today, we are announcing two improvements – as part of our efforts to transform and relaunch Aeroplan later this year,"" said Mark Nasr, Vice President, Loyalty and eCommerce at Air Canada. ""The redesigned Aeroplan will make it easier to travel and offer an improved experience to all members—both frequent and infrequent travelers.  We're confident that everyone will see new features that speak directly to them and better suit their travel needs – once they are ready to travel again."" 
Since announcing that it would launch a new loyalty program in 2020, Air Canada has connected with over 36,000 consumers to learn what attributes and benefits they want from a travel loyalty program. These new features directly reflect that feedback, allowing members to:  

Buy or Gift Aeroplan Miles at any time. Members can now purchase miles for themselves or give the gift of miles to other Aeroplan Members, at any time, through aeroplan.com. Previously, members could only purchase miles to top up their Aeroplan account when they were making a flight reward booking (which continues to be available). Members can also continue to transfer their miles to another member. 
Use Aeroplan Miles to submit offers for an AC Bid Upgrade. Members now have the option to use Aeroplan Miles when bidding for an upgrade to a higher cabin. Previously, customers could only bid for a cabin upgrade using a credit card at aircanada.com. This is the first of what will be many new ways for members to access popular extras and premium travel features to make their trip stress-free and more comfortable.

In developing these new options, Air Canada worked with two Canadian firms, both existing business partners: Montreal-based Plusgrade, a leader in ancillary revenue and merchandising solutions for AC Bid Upgrade and Toronto-based Points for the Buy/Gift Miles feature.
""Air Canada is proud to work with two Canadian success stories on these new features.  Working together with these businesses during such challenging times, while utilizing at-home resources, shows just how capable our partners are and helps support local jobs and our economy during this difficult period. With airline and hotel customers in every corner of the globe, they're the undisputed leaders in their respective spaces because they innovate with win-win products benefiting both travelers and loyalty program operators,"" added Mr. Nasr. 
To help members get ready for their future travels while they're at home, starting today at 10:00 am ET, and through May 13th, Aeroplan members will enjoy significant bonuses for all miles purchased:


For the first 10 million Aeroplan Miles purchased, eligible Aeroplan Members get a 115% bonus; 
For the next 100 million Aeroplan Miles purchased, eligible Aeroplan Members will get a 90% bonus; 
For all Aeroplan Miles purchased afterwards, through the end of the promotion, eligible Aeroplan Members will get a 65% bonus.


As part of this offer and the Air Canada Travel at Home campaign, Aeroplan and its partner Points, will match a portion of the Aeroplan Miles purchased and donate them towards one of our Aeroplan Member Donation program charities - The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Foundation (CAMH). 
Please visit here for more information.  
More customer-friendly changes and program improvements will be announced prior to the unveiling of Air Canada's transformed loyalty program later this year.

MONTREAL, May 4, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada (TSX: AC) (OTCQX: ACDVF) announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a shareholder rights plan to renew Air Canada's existing rights plan. The renewed rights plan is substantially unchanged from Air Canada's current rights plan. It is not being adopted in response to any specific proposal to acquire control of Air Canada, nor is the Board of Directors aware of any pending or threatened take-over bid for Air Canada. The renewed rights plan is similar to plans recently adopted by other Canadian companies and approved by their shareholders.
The renewed rights plan will ensure that Air Canada and its shareholders continue to receive the benefits associated with Air Canada's current shareholder rights plan, which is due to expire at the close of business on the date immediately following Air Canada's 2020 annual meeting of shareholders. As with the current plan, the renewed rights plans is designed to ensure that all shareholders of Air Canada are treated fairly in connection with any take-over offer or other acquisition of control of Air Canada.
The renewed rights plan will be effective at the close of business on the date immediately following its confirmation and approval by shareholders at Air Canada's annual meeting of shareholders scheduled for June 25, 2020. If so approved, the renewed rights plan will remain in effect until the close of business on the date of Air Canada's annual meeting of shareholders in 2023 and would be renewed in accordance with its terms for an additional period of three years (from 2023 to 2026) provided that the shareholders ratify such renewal at or prior to the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2023.
A complete copy of the rights plan will be filed and available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

Air Canada CleanCare+ Program Introduces New Personal Safety and Sanitary Measures to Give Customers Added Assurance

Comprehensive program to provide greater peace of mind during all stages of travel

Mandatory pre-flight customer temperature checks, the first in the Americas 
More personal space in Economy Class at least until June 30, 2020 
Personal care kits containing disinfectant and safety items 
Electrostatic cabin spraying to reinforce aircraft grooming protocols  
Revised food product minimizing crew and passenger contact 
Customer face-coverings and employee Personal Protective Equipment now mandatory

MONTREAL, May 4, 2020 /CNW/ - Air Canada today announced the launch of Air Canada CleanCare+, a comprehensive program for personal safety and enhanced aircraft grooming to provide customers greater peace of mind during all stages of travel. The new program is designed to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19 through such measures as mandatory pre-flight customer temperature checks in addition to required health questionnaires, seat assignment policies to allow for more personal space in Economy Class on all flights until June 30, 2020, and by providing all customers with care kits for hand cleaning and hygiene.
To supplement these individual measures, Air Canada CleanCare+ will also strengthen the airline's industry-leading cabin grooming standards with the introduction of electrostatic spraying of cabin interiors. Air Canada will additionally expand its existing aircraft grooming procedures, which already incorporate the use of hospital grade disinfectant and specialized techniques to maintain cabin cleanliness across its fleet.
""While we are eager to see the reopening of economies and the restart of commercial aviation, the safety of our customers and employees is Air Canada's core value and we aim to establish the highest standards of hygiene, cleanliness and attention to public health guidelines. We have been a leader in progressively introducing new measures in response to COVID-19, such as introducing Personal Protective Equipment for our employees and being the first North American carrier to require face coverings for customers. We are now the first airline in the Americas to administer pre-flight temperature checks system-wide. With Air Canada CleanCare+, we are introducing a comprehensive new program to give each customer added assurance for their well-being throughout all stages of their journey - and we intend to continue enhancing Air Canada CleanCare+ where we can with best practices from around the world, including increased use of screening tools, such as blood oxygen level testing, as they become available,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada.
""Air Canada CleanCare+ will not only provide protections at the personal level, by better monitoring our customers' fitness to fly and providing for more personal space in Economy Class, but it also sets new standards for cabin cleanliness and ensures our employees have the best tools to maintain it. Coupled with other new safety practices we implemented earlier in response to COVID-19, Air Canada CleanCare+ will provide travellers with the confidence that they can book and fly safely with Air Canada as they consider their travel plans in the current environment.""
In order to ensure the safety and well-being of all customers, through the Air Canada CleanCare+ program Air Canada will introduce the following measures by May 15:

Customers travelling on Air Canada flights will be subject to an infra-red temperature check at all airports, the first airline in the Americas to announce such measures system-wide. The non-invasive procedure will complement the existing government-mandated health questionnaire currently completed by all travellers to determine their fitness to fly. Customers who are deemed unfit to travel will be rebooked at no cost but be required to obtain medical clearance prior to travel. 
To promote more personal space in Economy Class aboard its aircraft, Air Canada will automatically block the sale of adjacent seats and cap the total number of seats sold for each flight. As a result, no customer in Economy Class will be required to sit immediately adjacent to another, unless they are required to do so to assist another customer with whom they are travelling. This policy will remain in effect until at least June 30, 2020. 
Air Canada will begin distributing care kits containing hand sanitizers and other health items to all customers. 
Air Canada has already been recognized by the 2019 Skytrax World Airline Awards for Best Airline Cabin Cleanliness in North America. With the onset of COVID-19 the airline has strengthened its cabin grooming standards and will begin using state-of-the-art electrostatic sprayers to ensure a deeper clean with hospital grade disinfectant.

For more information about Air Canada CleanCare+ please see https://www.aircanada.com/cleancareplus
Prior to Air Canada CleanCare+, Air Canada had already taken a number of measures in response to COVID-19. These will remain in effect and be included in the Air Canada CleanCare+ Program:

Requiring customers to wear face coverings during their travel, including at check-in, during boarding and as directed while onboard its aircraft. 
Protocols for the use of Personal Protective Equipment by employees, including face shields and coverings, gloves and gowns by in-flight crew, along with other safety measures to encourage physical distancing, such as a revised boarding procedure and a new onboard service program. 
To reduce personal interactions and promote physical distancing, Air Canada has adapted its check-in procedures. This includes making available on its self-serve web and mobile check-in and airport kiosk platforms government entry requirements, the mandatory health questionnaire and other relevant information. Air Canada is also working with airports on additional protective and sanitary measures. 
Temporary adjustments to on-board service such as individual water bottles instead of bar service offerings and the removal of pillows and blankets. Air Canada enRoute and other non-safety literature have been removed from all seatback pockets. Air Canada partnered with a third-party company that monitors infectious diseases all over the world using Artificial Intelligence and other predictive tools and provides the company with information in real-time to ensure it is equipped to make appropriate and timely decisions. 
For customers who have already purchased tickets and are looking to change their travel, Air Canada has revised its booking policies so there is no change or cancellation fee for existing or new bookings. Additionally, for customers whose flights have been cancelled due to the impacts of COVID-19, they can retain the unused amount of their ticket for up to 24 months.

Air Canada Reports First Quarter 2020 Results

MONTREAL, May 4, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today reported first quarter 2020 EBITDA(1) (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $71 million compared to first quarter 2019 EBITDA of $583 million  The airline reported an operating loss of $433 million compared to operating income of $127 million in the first quarter of 2019. At March 31, 2020, unrestricted liquidity amounted to $6.523 billion compared to unrestricted liquidity of $7.380 billion at December 31, 2019. 
""Our first quarter results reflect the severity and abruptness of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on Air Canada, which started to be felt across the global airline industry in late January with the suspension by many carriers, including Air Canada, of services to China. The impact was exacerbated during the month of March with mandated social distancing, unprecedented government-imposed travel restrictions in Canada and around the world and the shutting down of economies.  As significant as the financial damage has been, our prime concern remains the health and safety of our customers and our employees, whom I thank for their unwavering dedication under impossible conditions. I also want to acknowledge the pandemic's effects upon all of our other stakeholders, particularly those in the travel trade community. Be assured that we are resolutely committed to bringing our airline successfully through this crisis,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada.
""The past quarter was the first in 27 consecutive quarters that we did not report year-over-year operating revenue growth. Our solid January and February results gave us every encouragement that this performance would continue until the sudden and catastrophic impact of COVID-19's onset in Europe and North America in early March. We are now living through the darkest period ever in the history of commercial aviation.
""Over the last decade, we have infused entrepreneurial spirit, resilience, innovation and discipline into Air Canada's DNA and these attributes will serve us well as we navigate through this crisis. Due to disciplined long-term capital allocation we ended 2019 with $7.380 billion in unrestricted liquidity and still have access to significant unencumbered assets to support additional financings. We reacted quickly to the severity and abrupt impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking numerous measures, including drawing down credit lines and completing other financings to increase our liquidity, reducing our close-in capacity by more than 90 per cent, instituting a significant cost reduction and capital reduction and deferral program and implementing a temporary furlough of the majority of our unionized and management workforce, as well as management wage reductions for continuing employees.
""We have developed a plan to manage through a protracted downturn, recognizing that the pandemic and its fallout will materially impact both customer demand and our liquidity in the short and medium term. Moreover, while the duration of the pandemic and its fallout remain unknown, it is our current expectation that it will take at least three years to recover to 2019 levels of revenue and capacity. We expect that both the overall industry and our airline will be considerably smaller for some time, which will unfortunately result in significant reductions in both fleet and employee levels. While it is not possible to predict the course of the pandemic globally or indeed the changes that will be required of the airline industry, our determination is to ensure that our company is positioned to emerge in the post-COVID-19 world as strong as possible and capitalize on the opportunities that will inevitably arise,"" concluded Mr. Rovinescu.
Air Canada has taken or will take the following measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:

Air Canada has reduced second quarter 2020 capacity by 85 to 90 per cent when compared to 2019's second quarter. Third quarter 2020 capacity is expected to be reduced by approximately 75 per cent when compared to the third quarter of 2019. The airline will continue to dynamically adjust capacity and take other measures as required to account for health warnings, travel restrictions, border closures globally and passenger demand. 
In March 2020, Air Canada drew down its US$600 million and $200 million revolving credit facilities for aggregate net proceeds of $1.027 billion. As at March 31, 2020, Air Canada's unrestricted liquidity amounted to $6.523 billion. 
In April 2020, Air Canada concluded a 364-day term loan in the amount of US$600 million, secured by aircraft and spare engines, for net proceeds of $829 million. After giving effect to this facility and estimated declines in asset valuations as a result of COVID-19, Air Canada's unencumbered asset pool (excluding the value of Aeroplan and Air Canada Vacations) amounts to approximately $2.6 billion. As part of Air Canada's ongoing efforts to increase liquidity levels, additional financing arrangements continue to be pursued. 
In late April 2020, Air Canada concluded a bridge financing of $788 million for 18 Airbus A220 aircraft which may be used for general corporate purposes and which Air Canada expects to replace with longer-term secured financing arrangements later in 2020 with the same lender. 
In addition to cost savings associated with the significant capacity reductions, workforce reductions and other mitigation programs, Air Canada has initiated a company-wide cost reduction and capital reduction and deferral program which has now reached approximately $1.050 billion, increased from an initial target of $500 million, and continues to seek additional opportunities for cash preservation. 
Air Canada is accelerating the retirement of 79 older aircraft from its fleet – Boeing 767, Airbus 319 and Embraer 190 aircraft, with the Embraer aircraft exiting the fleet immediately. Their retirement will simplify the airline's overall fleet, reduce its cost structure, and lower its carbon footprint. 
Air Canada suspended share purchases under its Normal Course Issuer Bid in early March 2020 and does not intend to renew it upon its expiry. 
To assist with global requirements of goods and personal protective equipment during the pandemic, Air Canada has operated more than 500 all-cargo international flights since March 22, 2020, and plans to operate up to 150 all-cargo flights per week in the second quarter using a combination of Boeing 787 and Boeing 777 aircraft as well as four newly converted Boeing 777 and four converted Airbus 330 aircraft where it has doubled available cargo space by removing seats from the passenger cabin. 
Air Canada has adopted the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) for most of its workforce which allowed it to return previously furloughed Canadian-based employees to its payroll for the March 15 to June 6, 2020 period. 
Air Canada announced special benefits and accommodations for Aeroplan and Altitude members in light of COVID-19. These include pausing mileage expiration, grandfathering mileage-earned status, waiving certain change and redeposit fees, and launching new promotions so that members can earn additional Aeroplan Miles without leaving home. 
Air Canada makes safety its first consideration in all that it does and has been continually incorporating new information about COVID-19 into its health and safety policies and procedures for travelers and employees in all workplaces, airports and onboard aircraft. This includes a requirement for customers to wear a protective face covering and measures to implement social distancing, as well as enhanced protective personal equipment for airport agents and crews, the encouragement of safe practices such as frequent hand washing and collaborating with the Canadian federal government to screen passengers to determine fitness for flying of all customers. For more details on preventative measures and policies please see: https://www.aircanada.com/covid19updates 
To underscore its commitment to customer and employee safety, Air Canada will soon be introducing Air Canada CleanCare+. This program sets out all the health and safety measures being implemented at every touch point of the flight journey.

First Quarter SummaryAir Canada recorded a net loss of $1.049 billion or $4.00 per diluted share compared to net income of $345 million or $1.26 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019. The first quarter of 2020 included foreign exchange losses of $711 million while the first quarter of 2019 included foreign exchange gains of $263 million. The airline reported an adjusted net loss(1)  of $392 million or $1.49 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2020 compared to adjusted net income(1)  of $17 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019.  
Net debt of $4.170 billion increased $1.329 billion from December 31, 2019, reflecting the drawdown of Air Canada's US$600 million and $200 million revolving credit facilities, partially offset by debt repayments of $509 million. The unfavourable impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, as at March 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, increased foreign currency denominated debt (mainly U.S. dollars) by $692 million.  At March 31, 2020, Air Canada's leverage ratio(1)   (net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA ratio) was 1.3 versus a leverage ratio of 0.8 at December 31, 2019.
In the first quarter of 2020, net cash flows used in operating activities amounted to $20 million, a decrease of $3,131 million from the same quarter in 2019 on a deterioration in operating results and lower cash from working capital as a result of lower advance ticket sales, reflecting the severe and abrupt impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Cash flows from operating activities in the first quarter of 2019 were favourably impacted by receipts amounting to $1,612 million in conjunction with Air Canada's acquisition of Aeroplan. In the first quarter of 2020, net cash inflows from financing activities amounted to $387 million, an increase of $689 million from the first quarter of 2019.
Proceeds from borrowings of $1,027 million in the first quarter of 2020 reflected the drawdown of Air Canada's US$600 million and $200 million revolving credit facilities in March 2020. Debt repayments amounted to $509 million. Negative free cash flow(1)  of $393 million deteriorated by $972 million from the first quarter of 2019, reflecting lower cash flows from operating activities due to the severe and abrupt impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a lower level of capital expenditures year-over-year. 
Outlook and Major AssumptionsAs indicated above, Air Canada expects to reduce second quarter 2020 capacity by 85 to 90 per cent when compared to 2019's second quarter. Third quarter 2020 capacity is expected to be reduced by approximately 75 per cent when compared to the third quarter of 2019.  The airline will continue to dynamically adjust capacity and take other measures as required to account for health warnings, travel restrictions, border closures globally and passenger demand.
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and significant uncertainty around resulting travel restrictions and passenger demand, concerns about travel due to the pandemic or precautions such as physical distancing, as well as the overall economic environment and recent significant volatility in fuel prices and foreign exchange rates, Air Canada is not providing assumptions around GDP, fuel prices or foreign exchange rates. In addition, Air Canada is withdrawing all guidance, including as previously announced, all first quarter and full year 2020 guidance as well as its full year 2021 guidance (including its free cash flow guidance for the 2019-2021 period). 
(1) Non-GAAP MeasuresBelow is a description of certain non-GAAP financial measures used by Air Canada to provide readers with additional information on its financial and operating performance. Such measures are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  Readers are advised to review the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Air Canada's 2019 MD&A for a further discussion of such non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of such measures to Canadian GAAP.

Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share – diluted are used by Air Canada as a means to assess the overall financial performance of its business without the after-tax effects of foreign exchange gains or losses, net financing expense relating to employee benefits, gains or losses on financial instruments recorded at fair value, gains or losses on sale and leaseback of assets, gains or losses on debt settlements and modifications, gains or losses on disposal of assets, and special items as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to view operating results before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as these costs can vary significantly among airlines due to differences in the way airlines finance their aircraft and other assets. Air Canada excludes special items from EBITDA as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 
""Leverage ratio"" refers to net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA leverage ratio and is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to measure financial leverage. Leverage ratio is calculated by dividing net debt by trailing 12-month EBITDA (excluding special items). As mentioned above, Air Canada excludes special items from EBITDA results (which are used to determine leverage ratio) as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 
Free cash flow is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as an indicator of the financial strength and performance of its business, indicating the amount of cash Air Canada is able to generate from operations and after capital expenditures. Free cash flow is calculated as net cash flows from operating activities minus additions to property, equipment and intangible assets, and is net of proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions. Free cash flow in 2019 also excludes the one-time proceeds related to the Aeroplan acquisition.

Air Canada's First Quarter 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and its First Quarter 2020 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition are available on Air Canada's website at aircanada.com and will be filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONThis news release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Forward-looking statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable.  These statements may involve, but are not limited to, comments relating to guidance, strategies, expectations, planned operations or future actions. Forward-looking statements are identified using terms and phrases such as ""preliminary"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""could"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""intend"", ""may"", ""plan"", ""predict"", ""project"", ""will"", ""would"", and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions.   Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are based on assumptions, including those described herein and are subject to important risks and uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements cannot be relied upon due to, amongst other things, changing external events and general uncertainties of the business.  Actual results may differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below.
Air Canada, along with the rest of the global airline industry, is facing a severe and abrupt drop in traffic and a corresponding decline in revenue as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the travel restrictions imposed in many countries around the world, including Canada and the United States.  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began to be felt in traffic and sales figures commencing in early March 2020. These impacts include drastic declines in earnings and cash from operations. There is very limited visibility on travel demand given government restrictions in place; these restrictions and concerns about travel due to the COVID-19 virus and passenger expectations about the need for certain precautions such as physical distancing are severely inhibiting demand. Air Canada cannot predict the full impact or the timing for when conditions improve. Air Canada is actively monitoring the situation and will respond as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, which will depend on a number of factors including the course of the virus, government actions, and passenger reaction, none of which can be predicted with any degree of certainty.
Other factors that may cause results to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements include our ability to successfully achieve or sustain positive net profitability, economic and geopolitical conditions, the timing and conditions of the return to service of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in our fleet (including the introduction of those on order and the management of our fleet and operations until their return to service or introduction), industry and market conditions and the demand environment, competition, energy prices, our dependence on technology, our ability to successfully implement appropriate strategic and other important initiatives (including our ability to reduce operating costs), cybersecurity risks, war, terrorist acts, other epidemic diseases, our dependence on key suppliers, casualty losses, changes in laws, regulatory developments or proceedings, our ability to successfully launch and operate our new loyalty program, climate change and environmental factors (including weather systems and other natural phenomena and factors arising from man-made sources), interruptions of service, our dependence on regional and other carriers, our ability to preserve and grow our brand, employee and labour relations and costs, our dependence on Star Alliance and joint ventures, limitations due to restrictive covenants, our ability to pay our indebtedness and maintain liquidity, pending and future litigation and actions by third parties, currency exchange, pension plans, our ability to attract and retain required personnel, insurance issues and costs, as well as the factors identified in Air Canada's public disclosure file available at www.sedar.com and, in particular, those identified in section 14 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's First Quarter 2020 MD&A and section 20 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's 2019 MD&A.  Furthermore, the acquisition of Transat A.T. Inc. is subject to regulatory approvals and certain customary conditions, and there are no assurances that the acquisition will be completed as described in Air Canada's 2019 MD&A or at all. The forward-looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this news release represent Air Canada's expectations as of the date of this news release (or as of the date they are otherwise stated to be made) and are subject to change after such date. However, Air Canada disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable securities regulations.

Adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), EBITDA margin, free cash flow, ROIC, leverage ratio, adjusted earnings (loss) per share–diluted and adjusted CASM are each non-GAAP financial measures and net debt is an additional GAAP measure. Refer to section 16 of Air Canada's First Quarter 2020 MD&A for descriptions of Air Canada's non-GAAP financial measures and additional GAAP measures.  




(2) 
Unrestricted liquidity refers to the sum of cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investments, and the amount of available credit under Air Canada's revolving credit facilities. At March 31, 2020, unrestricted liquidity was comprised of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6,128 million, and long-term investments of $395 million. At March 31, 2019, unrestricted liquidity was comprised of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5,876 million, long-term investments of $162 million and undrawn lines of credit of $1,001 million. 




(3)

Such number of aircraft in Air Canada's operating fleet at March 31, 2020 includes a number of aircraft that have been temporarily grounded due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as 24 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft which have been grounded since 2019.  Refer to section 5 ""Fleet"" of Air Canada's First Quarter 2020 MD&A for additional information.   




(6) 
Average stage length is calculated by dividing the total number of available seat miles by the total number of seats dispatched. 




(7) 
Revenue passengers are counted on a flight number basis (rather than by journey/itinerary or by leg) which is consistent with the IATA definition of revenue passengers carried.

Last flights between Canada and the U.S. will operate April 26, resume May 22
MONTREAL, April 21, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced that it will suspend scheduled service to the U.S. after April 26 as a result of the agreement between the governments of Canada and the United States to extend border restrictions by an additional 30 days, effective today. Air Canada plans to resume service to the U.S. May 22, subject to any further government restrictions beyond that date.
The airline is waiving change fees for affected customers with bookings during this period to enable them to reschedule their travel with no additional fee. Customers can find more information about Air Canada's rebooking policies and revised schedule at www.aircanada.com
Since March 16, Air Canada has reduced its schedule by more than 90 per cent as a result of COVID-19. Following the initial announcement of U.S.-Canada travel restrictions on March 21, Air Canada maintained limited service to 11 U.S. destinations from its three Canadian hubs, primarily to facilitate the repatriation of Canadians. The last scheduled commercial flight from the U.S. to Canada will be on April 26.
More information about Air Canada's COVID-19 response is available at https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/book/travel-news-and-updates/2020/covid-19.html

Air Canada Proudly Brings Thousands of Canadians Home

Compilation video available at https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/fly/fly-the-flag.html
MONTREAL, April 20, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - As its special flights operated in collaboration with the Government of Canada draw to an end, Air Canada today saluted hundreds of its employees who have worked to fly thousands of stranded Canadians home. The program, which began March 21, has repatriated approximately 6,600 Canadians from Morocco, Spain, Ecuador, Peru, Algeria, Argentina, and Colombia.
""Overnight, the COVID‑19 crisis struck the entire planet in unprecedented ways and thousands of our fellow Canadians found themselves stranded abroad as a result of the numerous restrictions quickly imposed by various governments,"" said Ferio Pugliese, Senior Vice President, Air Canada Express and Government Relations at Air Canada. ""Heartfelt thanks must first be given to our crews, who agreed to be on the front lines to support these thousands of people eager to get home to be among their loved ones during these difficult times. The tireless efforts, dedication, compassion and professionalism of our employees on the ground and the terrific job they did expertly carrying out these complex, global operations have been nothing short of exemplary. Our customers and their families have shared with us their relief and feeling as if they were already home, once they boarded our flights, and we are proud to bring them back to Canada."" 
In total, Air Canada operated 21 special flights using wide‑body aircraft in close cooperation with Global Affairs Canada. Air Canada remains available to operate additional special flights in collaboration with the federal government. The program to date has included:

Seven flights from Lima 
Four flights from Quito 
Three flights from Casablanca 
Four flights from Algiers 
One flight from Barcelona 
One flight from Bogotá 
One flight from Buenos Aires

""Over the past few weeks, we have mounted one of the largest repatriation operations of Canadian travellers stranded abroad in the country's history. All returning travellers are subject to a mandatory self-isolation period of 14 days. We faced unprecedented obstacles, from airspace closures to tight travel restrictions,"" said François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Foreign Affairs. ""Air Canada played a vital role in bringing thousands of our fellow Canadians home. I want to thank all those who worked day and night to make this major undertaking possible.""
Over 300,000 Canadians transported on Air Canada's commercial flights
Despite a significant reduction in its network, Air Canada continues its repatriation efforts on its regular commercial flights. Since March 15, it has brought more than 300,000 passengers back to Canada from Asia, Europe, Caribbean/South America and the United States. This included Canadians repatriated from India, South Africa, Croatia, Serbia and the UAE through its London-Heathrow air link. 
Nearly 250 tonnes of PPE delivered across the country
Through Air Canada Cargo, Air Canada continues its operations to transport medical supplies and essential goods. Since March 1st, it has carried nearly 250 tonnes of personal protective equipment (PPE) across the country. The first flight full of freight on Air Canada's converted Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft arrived on April 18 from Shanghai via Narita with more than 20 tonnes of face masks, many for Canadian front-line health care workers. Air Canada has operated 106 all-cargo flights since March 22 between Asia, Europe, South America, and Canada and plans to operate up to 20 all-cargo flights per week using a combination of the three newly converted Boeing 777s and Boeing 787s, in addition to current scheduled flights to London, Paris, Frankfurt, and Hong Kong. Air Canada Cargo has been working with its supply chain partners and shippers to transport medical supplies from Asia and Europe to Canada and will continue exploring additional opportunities as needed in all regions of the globe. Its freight division has long been a key player and a crucial link in global supply chains, and the disruptions caused by the COVID‑19 pandemic are making cargo capacities more important than ever. 
Over 14,000 kg of food re-distributed across Canada
To date, Air Canada and the Air Canada Foundation have donated 14,118 kg of food items originally intended for Air Canada flights, the equivalent of nearly 31,000 meals to be redistributed to help support Canadian families in need. This national food rescue effort through Second Harvest has directly supported 17 organizations across the country from Vancouver to Halifax, including Leduc & District Food Bank, Leftovers Foundation, DreamMind Inc., among several others. 
About Air Canada

Air Canada Customers Required to Have Protective Face Coverings as Additional Safeguard

Français

Share this article














































Air Canada's recommended face-covering practice becomes mandatory with Transport Canada Directive where social distancing is not possible
MONTREAL, April 17, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Following Transport Canada's directive today, Air Canada is making its recommended face-covering practice mandatory as an additional safeguard for its customers and crew. This requirement will apply to customers at various points in Canadian airports, during the boarding process and during flight as may be directed by Air Canada staff where social distancing is not possible.
The requirement, effective April 20, follows a Directive issued today by the Minister of Transport of Canada requiring travellers to wear protective face-coverings at various stages of their air travel journey. Pursuant to the Ministerial Directive travellers will be required to show that they have a suitable face covering prior to boarding Air Canada flights.
Since early April, Air Canada has been strongly recommending that all customers wear a face-covering over their mouth and noses while onboard its flights following revised recommendations by the Public Health Agency of Canada. With today's Ministerial Directive, customers on all itineraries must wear such protection at check-in, at time of boarding, and upon entering the aircraft where social distancing is not possible. Customers will be asked to lower their masks to facilitate full ID checks as required by Canadian regulations at check-in. While on board, customers will be required to wear their face coverings, in accordance with the Ministerial Directive and in accordance with the directions from the cabin crew. 
Customers may bring their own face covering which may include a cloth mask, scarf or similar item. See PHAC website (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health.html) for examples of recommended non-medical coverings. Critical medical-grade masks will continue to be strictly reserved for frontline workers.
Air Canada has also implemented social (physical) distancing where possible during boarding and where feasible, on-board its aircraft, with as few people sitting next to one another as possible. Air Canada also recommends customers check-in online or via the Air Canada App prior to arriving at airports to minimize social contact at airport check-in areas.
Additional information about Air Canada's preventative measures are at: https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/book/travel-news-and-updates/2020/covid-19-preventive-measures.html
About Air Canada  Air Canada is Canada's largest domestic and international airline. Canada's flag carrier is among the 20 largest airlines in the world and in 2019 served over 51 million customers. Air Canada is a founding member of Star Alliance, the world's most comprehensive air transportation network. Air Canada is the only international network carrier in North America to receive a Four-Star ranking according to independent U.K. research firm Skytrax, which also named Air Canada the 2019 Best Airline in North America.

Three Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, the largest in Air Canada's fleet are being modified to transport cargo in the passenger cabin, doubling cargo capacity. 
Reconfigured aircraft can carry 89.63 tonnes, the equivalent of up to 9 million medical masks. 
40 all-cargo flights operated to date, with 20 all-cargo flights being planned weekly.

ATTENTION PHOTO EDITORS:  https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/about/media/photos-logos/gallery.html
MONTREAL, April 11, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today said it is reconfiguring the cabins of three of its Boeing 777-300ER aircraft to give them additional cargo capacity. The first aircraft conversion is complete and is now in service, with the second and third aircraft to be completed shortly.
""Bringing critical medical and other vital supplies rapidly to Canada and helping distribute them across the country is imperative to combating the COVID-19 crisis. The transformation of the Boeing 777-300ERs, our largest international wide-body aircraft, doubles the capacity of each flight and will enable more goods to move more quickly,"" said Tim Strauss, Vice President – Cargo at Air Canada.
""The rapid transformation of some of our aircraft to meet cargo demand reflects our ability to maximize our fleet assets quickly when these aircraft would otherwise be parked. Air Canada's engineering team worked around the clock to oversee the conversion work, and with Transport Canada to ensure all work was certified as tasks were completed. The next two aircraft are on track to be completed and will be in operation within the coming days,"" said Richard Steer, Senior Vice President, Operations at Air Canada.
The three Boeing 777-300ER aircraft are being converted by Avianor, an aircraft maintenance and cabin integration specialist, at its Montreal-Mirabel facility. Avianor developed a specific engineering solution to remove 422 passenger seats and designate cargo loading zones for light weight boxes containing medical equipment and restrained with cargo nets. This modification has been developed, produced and implemented within six days. All operations have been certified and approved by Transport Canada.
Through its cargo division, Air Canada has been using mainline aircraft that would otherwise be parked to operate cargo-only flights. The aircraft on these flights carry no passengers but move in their baggage holds time-sensitive shipments, including urgent medical supplies, and goods to support the global economy.
Air Canada has operated 40 all-cargo flights since March 22 and plans to operate up to 20 all-cargo flights per week using a combination of the three newly converted Boeing 777s, Boeing 787s and Boeing 777s, in addition to current scheduled flights to London, Paris, Frankfurt, Hong Kong.  Air Canada Cargo has been working with its supply chain partners and shippers to transport medical supplies from Asia and Europe to Canada and will continue exploring additional opportunities as needed in all regions of the globe.
Air Canada Cargo was just awarded the Gold Air Cargo Excellence Award, the only international carrier from North America to be recognized among the 2020 recipients. The Air Cargo Excellence Awards are based on the Air Cargo Excellence Survey (done annually by Air Cargo World). Carriers are ranked by freight forwarders and other customers based on their performance during the previous 12 months.

Air Canada Announces Intention to Adopt the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy for the Benefit of its 36,000 Canadian-based Employee Workforce

MONTREAL, April 8, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - On March 30, 2020, as part of an overall cost reduction program, Air Canada announced that its workforce in Canada will be temporarily reduced by approximately 50 per cent, or 16,500 jobs, as a result of the COVID-19 crisis and the imposition of global travel restrictions. 
On April 1, 2020, the Government of Canada announced the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) in order to help employers keep and/or return Canadian-based employees to payrolls for the Program Term of March 15, 2020 to June 6, 2020 in response to challenges posed by COVID-19. Details of the CEWS are still outstanding, but are intended to generally reimburse employers suffering revenue declines exceeding 30 per cent, which is the case for Air Canada. As a result of the crisis, Air Canada has abruptly reduced its seat capacity by 85 to 90 per cent and is incurring significant revenue losses. Any near-term recovery is reliant on the lifting of domestic and international travel restrictions and return of passenger traffic. 
Following an analysis of publicly available information on the CEWS, discussions with Department of Finance officials on certain questions of interpretation, and subject to its adoption into law substantially as announced, Air Canada intends to adopt the CEWS for the benefit of its 36,000 Canadian-based employee workforce. Air Canada's intention to adopt the CEWS has also received the support of all of its Canadian-based unions: ACPA, CALDA, CUPE, IAMAW and Unifor.  
As Air Canada (including subsidiaries Air Canada Rouge and Air Canada Vacations) has suffered a drop in consolidated revenues of more than 30 per cent and expects to continue to do so for the Program Term, it will apply for the CEWS retroactively to March 15, 2020 and retain or return affected employees to its payroll for the Program Term. 
In addition to the temporary workforce reductions, other measures implemented by Air Canada include: 

A company-wide cost reduction and capital deferral program, now estimated to be at least $750 million for the year, increased from the previous target of $500 million. 
Drawing down operating lines of credit of approximately $1 billion, to provide additional liquidity. 
Calin Rovinescu, Air Canada's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Rousseau, Air Canada's Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, have agreed to forgo 100 per cent of their salary. Senior Executives will forgo between 25 per cent to 50 per cent of their salary while members of Air Canada's Board of Directors have agreed to a 25 per cent reduction. All other Air Canada managers will have their salaries reduced 10 per cent for the entire second quarter. 
Air Canada suspended its share repurchase program in early March 2020.

""The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy is an extremely important program to help employees and employers during this time of crisis, and as one of Canada's largest employers most affected by COVID-19, we want to acknowledge the leadership of the Government of Canada in introducing it,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer at Air Canada. 
""While our seat capacity and operations have decreased by more than 90 per cent overnight, we are trying to keep as many of our employees as possible during the crisis and this measure will certainly help. Depending on wage levels, many furloughed employees will get a somewhat higher amount under CEWS than they would otherwise receive from Employment Insurance payments plus they will maintain their health insurance and other benefits and stay more connected to our company during the Program Period. Once the crisis passes and passenger demand increases, we look forward to returning as many employees as possible to active status as we resume normal operations,"" concluded Mr. Rovinescu.

Air Canada Provides Update in Response to Covid-19

MONTREAL, March 30, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that due to the unprecedented impact of Covid-19 upon its business, the airline will reduce capacity for the Second Quarter of 2020 by 85%-90% compared to last year's Q2 and will place 15,200 members of its unionized workforce on Off Duty Status and furlough about 1,300 managers. The workplace reductions will be effective on or about April 3 and are intended to be temporary.
""The unpredictable extent and duration of the Covid-19 pandemic requires a significant overall response.  To furlough such a large proportion of our employees is an extremely painful decision but one we are required to take given our dramatically smaller operations for the next while.  It will help ensure that Air Canada can manage through this crisis that is affecting airlines everywhere. We believe that the temporary nature of these reductions, many achieved through voluntary programs, combined with other mitigation measures, will position us to restore regular operations as soon as the situation improves,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive.
""I understand and regret the impact this will have upon our employees and their families. I thank all of our employees, as well as union leaders, for working with us constructively to quickly implement these measures"". 
In addition to the temporary workforce reductions, other measures implemented by Air Canada include:

A company-wide cost reduction and capital deferral program, targeting at least $500 million. 
Drawing down operating lines of credit of approximately $1 billion, to provide additional liquidity. 
Mr. Rovinescu, Air Canada's President & Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Rousseau, Air Canada's Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, have agreed to forgo 100% of their salary. Senior Executives will forgo between 25% - 50% of their salary while members of Air Canada's Board of Directors have agreed to a 25% reduction. All other Air Canada managers will have their salaries reduced 10% for the entire Second Quarter. 
Air Canada suspended its share repurchase program effective March 2, 2020. 

Earlier today, the Prime Minister of Canada announced a new wage subsidy program the details of which will be communicated later in the week and Air Canada will assess the impact of this on its mitigation plans. In addition, the Prime Minister also publicly acknowledged that the crisis faced by industries such as airlines will need additional help beyond wage subsidy and loan credit measures already announced by the federal government.
Subject to further government restrictions, while the crisis is ongoing Air Canada intends to continue to serve a small number of international and U.S. trans-border destinations from select Canadian cities after April 1, 2020 in addition to a reduced network in Canada.  In addition, Air Canada will also continue to operate special international flights in collaboration with the Government of Canada to repatriate Canadians abroad as well as cargo-only flights to ensure the continued movement of essential goods, including medical supplies.
Information about Air Canada's Covid-19 response including all schedule changes can be found at www.aircanada.com.

Air Canada and Air Canada Foundation Work with Second Harvest to Redistribute Onboard Fresh Food Items to Canadians in Need

Over 2,330 kg of fresh food from 7 cities across Canada redistributed to date 
Includes fresh veggies, salads, sandwich wraps, muffins, milk, with more to be distributed

MONTREAL, March 26, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada and the Air Canada Foundation are working with Canadian food rescue organization Second Harvest's FoodRescue.ca to redistribute fresh food items from Air Canada's in-flight kitchens as the airline begins suspending the majority of its international and U.S. transborder flights as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.
""While so many of us are staying home during these extraordinary times, we also remain united in taking care of each other. These difficult moments remind us of the importance of continuing to support our communities and help Canadian families in need.  Since we work with catering facilities across Canada, the network that Second Harvest offers through their national FoodRescue.ca platform enables us collectively to get these ready-to-eat food items to those who need it most as quickly as possible. To date, we have redistributed 2,330 kg of fresh veggies, salads, sandwich wraps, muffins and milk, and there will be more to distribute in the coming days,"" said Arielle Meloul-Wechsler, Executive Vice President, Chief Human Resources and Communications Officer at Air Canada.
""We are grateful to Air Canada for taking a leadership role in national food rescue efforts and to the Air Canada Foundation for continuing its tradition of community support,"" says Lori Nikkel, CEO of Second Harvest. ""FoodRescue.ca is a safe food donation platform for both donors and non-profits because it leverages the good health and business practices already in place, so we can make the food recovery process more efficient even before a single donation happens."" 
About Second Harvest:
Second Harvest is the largest food rescue organization in Canada, working across the supply chain from farm to retail to capture surplus food before it ends up in the landfill. With the escalating global pandemic, Second Harvest, a global thought leader in food recovery and redistribution, has developed the Food Rescue Canadian Alliance that brings together government, non-profit and private sectors to ensure food reaches the most vulnerable members of our communities from coast to coast. Visit foodrescue.ca to learn more. 
About the Air Canada Foundation
The Air Canada Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on the health and well-being of children and youth, was launched in 2012. It offers both financial and in-kind support to Canadian registered charities. Core programs include the Hospital Transportation Program, which donates Aeroplan Miles to 15 pediatric hospitals across Canada, enabling sick children to access the medical care they need but which are unavailable locally. The Air Canada Foundation, in collaboration with the airline, also engages directly in fundraising activities, such as the Every Bit Counts program, which encourages Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge customers to donate loose change of all denominations aboard flights or through collection containers available in Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounges. The Foundation also offers continued support to major health-related causes that benefit Canadians and is an active participant in international humanitarian relief activity as the need arises. For more information about the Air Canada Foundation, please visit aircanada.com/foundation or the 2018 Corporate Sustainability Report, Citizens of the World, online at aircanada.com/citizensoftheworld.

Air Canada Begins Operating Cargo-only Flights Carrying Vital Supplies, Necessary Goods

Shipments between Canada and Europe, South America and Latin America
MONTREAL, March 25, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that through its Air Canada Cargo division it has begun using its aircraft to operate cargo-only flights to Europe, with other flights planned for Latin America and South America. The aircraft on these flights carry no passengers but move time-sensitive shipments, including medical supplies to combat COVID-19, and goods to support the global economy. 
""Air Canada Cargo has long served as a vital link in global supply chains and with the disruption arising from the COVID-19 pandemic our capabilities are more important than ever. Although we have announced very significant temporary capacity reductions and our passenger flights are largely dedicated to bringing Canadians home, Air Canada's aircraft and our expertise in handling cargo are valuable assets that we can use to move medical supplies and other essential goods to keep the world economy going. We have already begun flights to Europe, and we are planning to expand this program to Latin America and South America, as well as within Canada, including remote communities using Air Canada Express aircraft. In addition to providing a much-needed service, these cargo-only flights are also supporting jobs at Air Canada,"" said Tim Strauss, Vice President of Cargo, at Air Canada.
The first cargo-only flights departed from Toronto this past week for Frankfurt, London and Amsterdam, which are all both important business centres and connection points for onward cargo shipments. The flights were operated using Boeing 787 aircraft capable of carrying 35 tonnes of cargo, the equivalent of about 80 grand pianos. Shippers and freight forwarders using the service are charged a flat rate for both directions and Air Canada Cargo is also introducing a fractional program, so shippers who do not require a whole aircraft can book space. The arrangements with the shippers and freight forwarders contain clear provisions to ensure that these essential goods are being sold at fair market rates and to authorized suppliers.   
Air Canada Cargo is now exploring opportunities to offer this service domestically. It is working with various governments to assess the demand and assist in moving relief goods from multiple markets within Canada. This includes using smaller Air Canada Express regional aircraft to operate to less-well served, smaller or remote regions in Canada with medical and other emergency supplies in support of local governments.
Air Canada does not operate cargo aircraft, instead its Air Canada Cargo division manages and markets excess belly space on the airline's regular passenger flights for shippers operating worldwide. To facilitate the cargo-only flights, Air Canada Cargo has created five, segment-specific sales teams to focus on the unique needs of the customers at different levels in the supply chain. For more information, including shipper inquiries, please see https://www.aircanada.com/cargo/en/.
About Air Canada 
Air Canada is Canada's largest domestic and international airline serving nearly 220 airports on six continents. Canada's flag carrier is among the 20 largest airlines in the world and in 2019 served over 51 million customers. Air Canada provides scheduled passenger service directly to 62 airports in Canada, 53 in the United States and 101 in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and South America. Air Canada is a founding member of Star Alliance, the world's most comprehensive air transportation network serving 1,250 airports in 195 countries. Air Canada is the only international network carrier in North America to receive a Four-Star ranking according to independent U.K. research firm Skytrax, which also named Air Canada the 2019 Best Airline in North America. For more information, please visit: aircanada.com/media, follow @AirCanada on Twitter and join Air Canada on Facebook.
About Air Canada Cargo

Flights from Lima, Quito and Barcelona 
Air Canada brings more than 200,000 Canadians home in one week 
More than 1,000 scheduled flights planned through to the end of the month to repatriate Canadians

MONTREAL, March 23, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada will operate six special flights from Lima, Barcelona and Quito this week to enable Canadians stranded abroad to return home. The flights, operated in collaboration with the Government of Canada, are part of Air Canada's ongoing efforts to repatriate Canadians. 
""Several hundred Canadians trapped in Peru, Ecuador and Spain since the imposition of restrictive travel measures by the authorities will finally be able to return home. Air Canada remains fully mobilized dealing with this global health crisis and we have committed to keep operating internationally, transborder to the U.S. and across Canada to allow people to return to Canadian soil as quickly as possible and transport important shipments of goods, including emergency supplies. I thank all our employees for their ongoing commitment, particularly our crews which are directly working on these flights, to bring Canadians home safely,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada. 
Peru
Air Canada will operate three flights between Toronto and Lima. The first departure from Canada scheduled for March 24 will also take back Peruvians who wish to return home. Two other special flights from Lima to Toronto are currently scheduled for March 26 and 27. The flights will be operated by a wide-body Boeing 777 aircraft with 400 seats. 
Ecuador
Flights from Quito to Toronto will begin March 25 on a wide-body Air Canada Rouge Boeing 767 with 281 seats.
Spain
On March 25, a flight will depart Barcelona for Montreal on a wide-body Boeing 787 Dreamliner with 297 seats. 
Canadians abroad must register with Global Affairs Canada to obtain a seat on one of these special flights. Travellers are also strongly encouraged to contact the local Canadian Embassy or [email protected] if urgent assistance is required.
More than 1,000 flights by the end of March

Two additional special flights from Morocco to take place this week 
Travellers must contact Global Affairs Canada to book seats 
In the last week, Air Canada transported thousands of Canadians back home

MONTREAL, March 22, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced today that, in collaboration with the Canadian Government, it will operate two more special flights from Morocco. These flights follow a successful special flight completed March 21 in which Air Canada brought 444 Canadians home from Morocco.
""We are working extremely hard 24/7 to bring thousands of Canadians home safely from around the world and we will continue to do so. Our priority at this time is to ensure that we can repatriate as many people as possible. Both on our own and with the Government of Canada and foreign authorities, we are working to organize these massively complex operations in the current global crisis. In the last week alone, we have brought more than 200,000 people back to Canada and we plan to keep operating flights to the end of March and beyond so Canadians continue to have a way home. I thank all of those involved for their tireless efforts in coordinating this initiative during these extremely uncertain and difficult times,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer at Air Canada.
These two additional flights are currently scheduled to operate on March 23 and 25 from Casablanca to Montreal with a 450-seat wide-body aircraft.
Global Affairs Canada is coordinating local arrangements for Canadians wishing to return home on these special flights. Canadians abroad are strongly encouraged to register with Global Affairs Canada. This will allow the Government of Canada to provide information to them as soon as it becomes available. For any emergency help you are encouraged to contact [email protected].
""The COVID 19 pandemic has created an unprecedented crisis in the global aviation industry that is already having a significant impact on the air transport industry, travellers, shippers and the economy. Right now, our priority is to help Canadians who are abroad to return to Canada. The Government of Canada is working with Air Canada to bring Canadians home from locations that are particularly challenging. I am pleased to see these flights beginning this weekend,"" declared The Honourable Marc Garneau, Minister of Transport.

We continue to work around the clock to provide all assistance possible to Canadians abroad who are affected by COVID-19. As part of these efforts, we are collaborating with Air Canada to facilitate commercial flights for Canadians who want to return home,"" added The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Foreign Affairs.

First of a planned series of flights to assist Canadians returning home

MONTREAL, March 20, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced today that the airline, in collaboration with the Government of Canada, will operate a special flight March 21 from Morocco to bring Canadians home.
""We understand it's a challenging time for all Canadians who are still abroad and anxious to come back home. Our teams are working around the clock with the Canadian Government and offering our global reach to do everything we can to repatriate as many Canadians as possible, recognizing that we will not be able to assist all,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada.
Air Canada will operate a wide body aircraft, with 450 seats, from, Casablanca, Morocco to Montreal. Global Affairs Canada is coordinating local arrangements for Canadians wishing to return home.
""We are doing everything possible to assist Canadians abroad to return home and we appreciate the support of Air Canada, which is providing its technical and operational expertise to help us. It is an excellent example of the type of cooperation and support the Government of Canada is encouraging in the face of this unprecedented public health crisis,"" said the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The Canadian Government has also announced that it will provide financial assistance for Canadians abroad directly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak to help secure their return.
It is important for those travelling to be reminded that only Canadian citizens, permanent residents and members of their immediate family holding a valid travel document will be permitted to board these flights to Canada. All passengers will undergo a health screening before boarding the aircraft. Any passenger presenting symptoms consistent with COVID-19 will be denied boarding unless they can present a medical certificate confirming any symptoms are not related to COVID-19.  Upon arrival in Canada, all passengers will be requested to self-isolate for a period of 14 days.

Airline further reducing schedule, maintaining essential services where possible
MONTREAL, March 18, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that it will gradually suspend the majority of its international and U.S. transborder flights by March 31, 2020 in response to decisions by national governments, including Canada and the United States, to close borders and restrict commercial aviation as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Subject to further government restrictions, the airline intends to continue to serve a small number of international and U.S. trans-border destinations from select Canadian cities after April 1, 2020. The airline also intends to continue serving all provinces and territories of Canada after that date, albeit with a significantly reduced network.
All schedule changes can be found at www.aircanada.com. 
International and U.S. transborder services
In order to facilitate the continued repatriation of citizens to their home countries, including Canadians back to Canada, and to support the essential movement of needed goods and cargo during the crisis, Air Canada intends to continue to operate a limited number of international ""air bridges"" between one or more of its Canadian hubs and the cities of London, Paris, Frankfurt, Delhi, Tokyo and Hong Kong from April 1 until at least April 30. This will reduce its international network from 101 airports to six.
As to U.S. transborder services, given the decision by the U.S. and Canadian governments today, from April 1, Air Canada will reduce its transborder network from 53 airports to 13, subject to further reductions based on demand or government edicts. The cities with continued service will be: New York (LGA and EWR), Boston, Washington, D.C. (IAD and DCA), Chicago, Houston, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale.
Domestic Canada network
Air Canada intends to continue to serve all provinces and territories of Canada, reducing its domestic network from 62 airports to 40 through a reduced network during the period April 1 to 30, subject to further reductions based on demand or government edict. 
For information on Air Canada's schedule beginning April 1, 2020 please see www.aircanada.com.
""The restrictions on travel imposed by governments worldwide, while understandable, are nonetheless having a cataclysmic effect upon the global airline industry. Our immediate focus is on ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities. At the same time, we are exploring with the Government of Canada possibilities to maintain essential operations to enable as many Canadians as possible to return to Canada, and to support other vital transport needs, including the shipment of goods and cargo during the crisis as required in any state of emergency. We are working around the clock to deal with the impact for our customers and our business of the various travel restrictions that are being made by governments at unprecedented speed without advance warning. We will also look at helping Canadians to return home by operating a limited number of charters from international destinations and exploring with the Government of Canada avenues in this regard. We will provide updates as details are finalized,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive of Air Canada.
For Affected Customers
The airline will gradually suspend some of its scheduled flights between now and March 31 as demand for Canadians to return to Canada from a number of destinations reduces. Please check Air Canada's website for details given the rapidly evolving situation.
Affected customers, including those with Air Canada Vacations packages, whose flights are cancelled will receive a full credit valid for 24 months. There is no requirement to contact Air Canada as customers will be contacted directly.
The airline has also put in place temporary, one-way fares to Canada to enable customers abroad to return home. Customers seeking to contact Air Canada are advised that contact centre wait times are elevated, so the airline has put in place a number of self-service tools to enable customers to manage their travel online. For more information please consult our COVID-19 webpage at www.aircanada.com.

Withdraws 2020 and 2021 guidance 
Current liquidity level of $7.3 billion 
Capacity reduction of 50 percent in the second quarter versus the prior year's quarter

MONTREAL, March 16, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada, along with the rest of the global airline industry, is facing a severe drop in traffic and a corresponding decline in revenue as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and travel restrictions imposed in many countries around the world, including Canada and the United States. Although the company expects this disruption to be temporary, as the full impact and duration of the outbreak is unknown, Air Canada is withdrawing its previously announced first quarter and full year 2020 guidance as well as its full year 2021 guidance (including its free cash flow guidance for the 2019-2021 period) while it takes steps to mitigate the financial impact on its business.
""COVID-19 presents the global airline industry with unprecedented challenges, compounded by uncertainty as to the extent of its effects. However, we are confident that after a decade of transformation and record results, Air Canada today has the agility, the team and the route network to successfully navigate through this crisis. Most importantly for business continuity, it also has the necessary financial resources, including a solid balance sheet, record liquidity levels, higher debt ratings based on a low leverage ratio, and a significant pension plan surplus.  These deep strengths enable us to fully focus our immediate attention on both the safety and well-being of our customers and our employees and on mitigating the financial impact of the virus,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada. 
""The crisis facing our industry is worsening as countries around the world adopt increasingly severe measures, national lockdowns and travel restrictions. We understand that the governments of the United States and many European countries such as Germany, France, Italy, Norway and others have approved or are considering assistance for their airline industries in one form or another. Under these circumstances, we believe that the Canadian airline industry should also see similar assistance, whether through forbearance of taxes, landing fees and other charges that form part of the aviation burden in Canada or otherwise until the industry stabilizes.  Our industry associations have been and will continue to make these representations to governments. However, we are not awaiting any decision on these measures before implementing our mitigation plan as we believe decisive action is the best course to follow.
""At Air Canada, our core value is Safety First, Always - for our employees and for our customers. We rigorously follow the guidance of all relevant health authorities and follow best demonstrated practices in the prevention and handling of communicable diseases in the air travel industry. Additionally, in the last year, we entered a partnership with an independent company that monitors infectious diseases and epidemics globally and provides us with information in real-time to ensure we are equipped to make the best decisions, on a timely basis,"" concluded Mr. Rovinescu.
Measures in Response to COVID-19

For the second quarter of 2020, Air Canada expects, on average, system ASM capacity to decline by approximately 50 percent versus the comparable period in 2019, reflecting capacity reductions in all key markets affected by COVID-19 or by travel restrictions. The reduction in capacity in Pacific markets for the month of April is expected to be approximately 75 percent. The company will continue to proactively adjust capacity as required. 
A combination of significantly lower jet fuel prices, the projected cost savings associated with capacity reductions, including workplace reductions and other programs, and a general cost reduction program is expected to mitigate between 50 and 60 percent of the company's total revenue loss for the second quarter of 2020. Air Canada believes that, excluding fuel and depreciation and amortization expenses, approximately 50 percent of its operating expenses are variable in nature. Air Canada has no current outstanding fuel hedge positions. 
To preserve cash, Air Canada is initiating a company-wide cost reduction and capital deferral program, targeting at least $500 million. 
Air Canada suspended its share repurchase program effective March 2, 2020. 
Air Canada drew down its US$600 million revolving credit facility. In addition, Air Canada is working with several parties to raise additional liquidity over the next several weeks, which will require pro-rata security from its unencumbered asset pool. 
Air Canada assumes that the Canadian dollar will trade, on average, at C$1.39 per U.S. dollar for both the second quarter and the remainder of 2020 and that the price of jet fuel will average 47 CAD cents per litre for the second quarter of 2020 and 50 CAD cents per litre for the remainder of 2020.

Liquidity 

Air Canada had cash, cash equivalents, short and long investments of $7.1 billion at March 13, 2020, which includes the proceeds from the drawdown of the U.S.-based revolving credit facility discussed above. In addition, it has a Canadian $200 million revolving credit facility which it intends to draw down in the next week. 
Air Canada's unencumbered asset pool (excluding the value of Aeroplan and Air Canada Vacations) amounts to approximately $5 billion. This includes 89 unencumbered aircraft, representing ASM capacity of approximately 25 percent. 
Air Canada originally projected a capital expenditure program for 2020 of $2.4 billion which will now decline after the deferrals noted above. This includes purchase commitments for 17 Airbus A220 and six Boeing 737 MAX aircraft totaling approximately $1.2 billion, which are still expected to be delivered and, subject to satisfactory lending arrangements, financed in 2020. Dependent on the impact of the COVID-19 virus, Air Canada will work with its aircraft partners in exploring the potential deferment of aircraft deliveries. 
Air Canada does not have any material debt maturities in 2020 and is confident all debt covenants, which are loan-to-security value measures in nature, will be met given the excess cushion that currently exists. 
As at January 1, 2020, the aggregate solvency surplus in Air Canada's domestic registered pension plans was $2.6 billion. Total employer defined benefit pension funding contributions are projected to be $100 million in 2020 ($109 million in 2019) and no additional contributions are required as a result of changes in interest rates. Air Canada has a significantly lower exposure to a decrease in interest rates and reduction in market equity values due to its pension risk mitigation strategy and, as a result, it expects to maintain a significant pension solvency surplus in its domestic registered pension plans for the year. 

Air Canada recently amended its 2013 order originally placed with Boeing for 61 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, reducing its initial order by 11 Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in 2023 and 2024.  This amendment reflects the company's evolving and long-term fleet planning requirements, and Air Canada intends to backfill this capacity. Air Canada currently has 24 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft in its fleet and has firm orders for 26 more Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft.
In its news release dated February 18, 2020, Air Canada disclosed that it was in discussions with Boeing to settle the terms of an arrangement in relation to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.  These discussions have now concluded, however, as the terms of the arrangement are subject to confidentiality restrictions, Air Canada will not be disclosing its terms.

MONTREAL, March 9, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has been named one of Canada's Best Diversity Employers for the fifth consecutive year.

In selecting Air Canada, Mediacorp Canada Inc. cited the airline’s continuing work to foster inclusiveness through numerous partnerships, its success outreaching directly to diverse communities when recruiting and other initiatives. (CNW Group/Air Canada)










""We firmly believe that having a diverse and inclusive workforce is not only a true strength for Air Canada, but one that helps us to attract and retain the best available global talent. We are extremely proud of the fact that our customers and stakeholders can see themselves and their diverse backgrounds reflected in our 37,000 employees around the world. Our people work in more than 80 languages, and women occupy prominent roles throughout our airline, from non-traditional roles to the C-suite,"" said Arielle Meloul-Wechsler, Executive Vice President, Chief Human Resources and Communications Officer at Air Canada.


""We actively advance diversity through several initiatives, including recruitment partnerships with Indigenous peoples, LGBTQ, people with disabilities and other communities, as well as championing the next generation of women in non-traditional aviation careers through the Captain Judy Cameron Scholarship. This honour is also welcome because it makes it clear that anyone with the right skills and aptitude can be sure Air Canada is inclusive and welcoming.""
In naming Air Canada to the list of Best Diversity Employers, Mediacorp Canada Inc. cited the airline's inclusivity through partnerships including: 
Indspire's Indigenous scholarship and award program, providing financial support for Indigenous students completing their education in an aviation-related program such as pilot or aircraft mechanic; 
A program with Jazz Aviation to create a partnership with First Nations Technical Institute to help young Aboriginal students become pilots – the initiative includes guidance on résumés and job interview preparation, as well as site visits to flight simulators and flight operations; 
Ready, Willing and Able to match the unique qualifications of candidates with intellectual disabilities or Autism Spectrum Disorder to specific roles – the company also participates in Dolphin Digital Technologies' disability mentoring day.
Canada's Best Diversity Employers competition recognizes the nations' leaders in creating inclusive workplaces for employees from five diverse groups:  women, visible minorities, persons with disabilities, Indigenous peoples, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender/transsexual (LGBTQ) peoples.  Employers are selected by the editors at Mediacorp based on submissions to the annual Canada's Top 100 Employers project. For more information on career opportunities with Air Canada please visit aircanada.com/careers. In addition to being named one of Canada's Best Diversity Employers for 2020, Air Canada has received other recent recognitions for employee relations and engagement including being named:
one of Canada's Top 100 Employers in Canada (2020) for the seventh consecutive year by Mediacorp Canada Inc; 
one of Montreal's Top Employers 2020 for the seventh consecutive year by Mediacorp Canada Inc; 
one of the 50 Most Engaged Workplaces in North America for Fourth Consecutive Year by Achievers; 
Additional information on Air Canada's Human Resources is in the ""Employees"" section of the 2018 Corporate Sustainability Report. About Air Canada Air Canada is Canada's largest domestic and international airline serving nearly 220 airports on six continents. Canada's flag carrier is among the 20 largest airlines in the world and in 2019 served over 51 million customers.

""We proudly salute and celebrate the achievements and contributions of the nearly 16,000 women who work at Air Canada around the world today.

Our message to young women is to follow your aviation dreams and know there are rewarding careers for all qualified people.""""This scholarship will help other women overcome financial barriers to pursue their dreams, whether flying airplanes or fixing them. Thank you to Air Canada for making it possible for me to experience the most amazing career in the world and for encouraging other young women in their passion for aviation. I admire the determination that these four amazing young women have to pursue their flying. Their accomplishments to date are outstanding. One day, I expect to be a passenger on an Air Canada airplane and hear them make the announcement, 'This is your Captain speaking',"" Judy said. The winners of the inaugural Captain Judy Cameron Scholarship, awarded in partnership with the Northern Lights Aero Foundation, each receive $5,000 toward their studies in aviation.  All four are also pursuing their commercial pilot's licence.

Share this article














































MONTREAL, Feb. 24, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has entered into letters of intent with each of AAR Aircraft Services Trois-Rivières ULC (""AAR"") and Avianor Inc (""Avianor"") regarding long-term agreements for airframe maintenance, subject to completion of its planned merger with Transat, A.T. These long-term agreements would enable each of AAR and Avianor to develop Airframe Maintenance Centres of Excellence in Quebec for the aircraft types within their areas of expertise, both stimulating new investment in aerospace in Quebec and creating more high-quality aircraft maintenance jobs.
The larger combined Airbus A330 fleet of Air Canada and Air Transat would enable Air Canada to move wide-body A330 maintenance work for both airlines from abroad to AAR in Trois-Rivières, in addition to maintaining and expanding AAR's airframe maintenance work in Quebec on the A320 family, including all new A321 neo aircraft.
In addition, Avianor would establish a new Centre of Excellence for Air Canada's new Airbus A220 fleet (formerly the Bombardier C-Series) in Mirabel, adjacent to Airbus' manufacturing facilities.
The letters of intent are subject to completion of final agreements which will include terms generally applicable to airframe maintenance agreements of this scale. 
AAR Aircraft Services – Trois-Rivières, Quebec
AAR currently performs airframe maintenance work in Trois-Rivières on Air Canada's existing Airbus A320 fleet and Embraer E190 fleet (which is being phased out).  
Air Canada and AAR have entered into a letter of intent that, subject to completion of the Transat merger by Air Canada, requisite Board of Directors' approvals and completion of final agreements, evidences the parties' intent to enter into a 10-year renewable agreement for airframe maintenance of both Air Canada's and Air Transat's fleet of Airbus A330 and A320 family of aircraft (including the new A321neo) in Trois-Rivières, Quebec.
AAR intends to make the necessary facility infrastructure investments in Trois-Rivières to accommodate the new wide-body A330 work of the combined Air Canada and Air Transat fleets, given that there would be sufficient volumes of heavy maintenance work to support such an investment and to develop a Centre of Excellence. Through this agreement, it is expected that incremental aerospace jobs will be created in Trois-Rivières and AAR's new capabilities should enable it to attract airframe maintenance work from other operators of the A330. 
""From our very first project in Trois-Rivières, we've seen a strong commitment to quality, safety and operational performance,"" said Rich Steer, Senior Vice-President, Operations at Air Canada. ""With our largest hub a short distance away, we're excited to have a trusted partner like AAR with a similar commitment to excellence, and also proud to be increasing heavy maintenance work in Quebec, especially on wide-body aircraft. This contract for additional work in Trois-Rivières represents a long-term investment in increased airframe maintenance in Quebec.""
""We are honoured to work closely with a highly regarded carrier like Air Canada for so many years and to be chosen as their maintenance provider for the A330 and A320 family fleet types,"" said Chris Jessup, Chief Commercial Officer, AAR Corp. ""AAR is proud to support the Canadian economy and to grow our overall footprint in Trois-Rivières, especially for the A330."" 
AAR Aircraft Services is a full-service aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) provider, wholly-owned and operated by AAR Corp. with over 290,000 sf of facilities in Trois-Rivières, Quebec and Windsor, Ontario, along with facilities in the United States.  AAR took over Premier Aviation's facilities in Trois-Rivières and Windsor in 2017. Since inception in 2002, the Trois-Rivières facility has experienced a steady growth of clients and services in general maintenance overhaul, modifications, refurbishment and paint requirements. In 2012, the Trois-Rivières facility started to perform MRO services for some of Air Canada's Embraer fleet, including painting and supporting backshops. AAR expanded Trois-Rivières MRO competencies in 2017 by performing all MRO services on Air Canada's Airbus A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. In September 2017, Air Canada awarded a 10-year contract to AAR for the maintenance of its 125 Airbus A320 and Embraer E190 single-aisle aircraft at the AAR facilities in Trois-Rivières, contributing to the continuance of 350 specialized jobs. This work was transferred to Quebec from AAR's Duluth, Minnesota facility. 
Avianor Inc. – Mirabel, Quebec
Air Canada and Avianor have entered into a letter of intent that provides for a 10-year agreement for airframe maintenance of Air Canada's new fleet of Airbus A220 aircraft in Mirabel, Quebec. The agreement is subject to completion of Air Canada's planned merger with Transat, A.T., and completion of final agreements. Air Canada has a firm order of 45 A220s with options for an additional 30 aircraft. Its initial aircraft entered into service in January 2020.
Avianor is well progressing in its study phase to construct a new 250,000-square-foot hangar in Mirabel in close proximity to the A220 manufacturing facilities of Airbus Canada (formerly the Bombardier facilities) in order to strategically position itself in the heavy maintenance, modification and completion of narrow-body aircraft and other key aircraft programs. The Air Canada work will position Avianor to attract airframe maintenance work from other A220 operators, as well to encourage other suppliers of the A220 to consider establishing operations nearby, thereby contributing to the establishment of a North American centre of excellence in Mirabel.  
Air Canada's Senior Vice-President, Operations, Rich Steer, stated, ""We have been very pleased with the work performed in Quebec by Avianor on Air Canada's fleet over the last years. This contract assures Air Canada of a quality solution for our Airbus A220 heavy maintenance needs in Quebec through Avianor's extensive and proven capabilities in this field."" 
""This extended relationship with Air Canada shows the scale of technical support that Avianor offers in this competitive marketplace. To build great projects we always need to be surrounded by key players such as Air Canada and it goes without saying that we are extremely proud of today's strategic announcement. We are thrilled to be working with Air Canada, in support of their expanded fleet and are grateful for their confidence. With years in the industry, we are confident in our ability to provide world-class quality, genuine partnerships and proven customer support while allowing ourselves to envision an enviable Centre of Excellence which could eventually regroup a variety of services such as maintenance, engineering, certification, education and training capabilities under one roof,"" said Benoit Hudon, President & CEO, Aerospace & Ground Transportation Division of DRAKKAR, majority owner of Avianor. 
Avianor was recently acquired by the Drakkar & Partner's Aerospace & Ground Transportation Division. Avianor specializes in maintenance, modifications and aircraft completion, including a highly skilled internal engineering support team. Avianor has positioned itself as a vertical integrator in the marketplace. The company occupies over 200,000 square feet of hangars, repair shops, fabrication facilities and warehouse space at Mirabel Airport (YMX) and employs more than 350 people.
In November 2019, Avianor reached a highly important milestone and has received Transport Canada (TCCA) approval to add the Airbus A220-100 and A220-300 to its maintenance capability list.

Record operating revenues of $19.131 billion 
Operating income of $1.650 billion 
EBITDA of $3.636 billion and EBITDA margin of 19 per cent 
Record unrestricted liquidity of $7.380 billion and leverage ratio of 0.8

MONTREAL, Feb. 18, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today reported 2019 EBITDA(1) (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment) of $3.636 billion compared to 2018 EBITDA of $3.213 billion, an increase of $423 million or 13 per cent. The airline reported operating income of $1.650 billion in 2019 compared to operating income of $1.496 billion in 2018.
""I am very pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year results for 2019, a year in which we generated record revenues in excess of $19 billion and reached record levels of unrestricted liquidity, despite the loss to Air Canada of approximately 25 per cent of our narrow-body fleet for most of the year following the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX. These results underscore the airline's ability to overcome major challenges as well as the deep commitment of Air Canada's 37,000 strong team, which took care of our customers under extremely complicated operational circumstances. With this backdrop, I am especially proud that we were able to deliver on the outlook we provided for key financial metrics for the year. Our discipline was rewarded by an 87 per cent return on our shares in 2019, which, when added to our returns over the previous nine years, made Air Canada the top performing stock on the TSX for the past decade with a 3,575 per cent return,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada.
""The agility and consistency that we displayed in 2019 gives me confidence that we will successfully execute on the several key opportunities now before us. This includes the launch of our new loyalty program later this year, which we expect will be the best airline loyalty program in the world. We also look forward to completing our proposed merger with Transat A.T., which was approved by nearly 95 per cent of Transat shareholders last summer and now remains subject to applicable regulatory approvals. This is a wholly Canadian solution that will secure jobs and result in more travel options and benefits for both airlines' customers and other stakeholders. 
""We start 2020 with uncertainty from the on-going Boeing 737 MAX grounding and the constraints it imposes, as well as emerging economic and geopolitical risks and route suspensions resulting from the COVID-19 virus. However, our strong balance sheet, globe-spanning network that diversifies our revenue sources, brand strength as North America's Best Airline as rated by Skytrax, young fleet, dedicated and talented employees and nimble management team equip us to respond effectively to any challenges that come our way. Our dedicated and professional team is highly motivated to deliver service excellence to our loyal customer base, and I thank both groups for contributing to our strong 2019 results in the face of adversity,"" said Mr. Rovinescu. 
Full Year 2019 Income Statement Highlights
Air Canada began consolidating Aeroplan's financial results on the date of the acquisition of Aeroplan, January 10, 2019.  
In 2019, on a capacity increase of 1.8 per cent, record system passenger revenues of $17.232 billion increased $1.071 billion or 6.6 per cent from 2018. The increase in system passenger revenues was driven by a yield improvement of 4.6 per cent and traffic growth of 1.9 per cent. System yield improved due to the constrained capacity resulting from the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft as well as a generally improved pricing environment, mainly in North America. The yield increase also included additional revenues from Aeroplan flight redemptions and other revenues subsequent to the Aeroplan acquisition.  
In 2019, operating expenses of $17.481 billion increased $974 million or 6 per cent from 2018. Air Canada's cost per available seat mile (CASM) increased 4.1 per cent from 2018. The airline's adjusted CASM(1) increased 6.1 per cent from 2018. These increases reflected, in large part, the impact of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft grounding, which resulted in a system ASM increase of 1.8 per cent versus planned system ASM growth of approximately 4.8 per cent, in addition to higher costs associated with replacement aircraft, and on-going operating expenses, including depreciation and pilot wages that continued to be incurred in relation to the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft despite their grounding.  Given that the Aeroplan loyalty business was not consolidated in Air Canada's financial results in 2018, for a more meaningful comparison of the cost performance of the on-going airline business, Air Canada's adjusted CASM for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 excludes the operating expenses of Aeroplan. Air Canada estimates that, had it operated the 36 Boeing MAX aircraft as originally planned during 2019, adjusted CASM would have reflected an increase of approximately 2.5 per cent when compared to 2018.   
Air Canada's full year 2019 EBITDA margin of 19.0 per cent met the target margin of approximately 19.0 per cent projected in Air Canada's news release dated October 29, 2019. Air Canada estimates that its 2019 EBITDA margin would have been approximately 30 basis points higher at 19.3 per cent, when excluding two fourth quarter one-time items, each of which similarly contributed to this impact:  (a) a one-time negative impact on revenue arising from Air Canada's transition, in mid-November, to a new passenger service system, and (b) higher than expected stock-based and other compensation expenses resulting from an increase in Air Canada's share price and from higher accruals in respect of employee profit sharing programs.
Full year 2019 net income amounted to $1.476 billion or $5.44 per diluted share compared to 2018 net income of $37 million or $0.13 per diluted share. The year 2019 included foreign exchange gains of $499 million while 2018 included foreign exchange losses of $578 million. Air Canada recorded a loss on disposal of assets of $188 million in 2018. Air Canada reported adjusted net income(1)  of $917 million or $3.37 per diluted share in 2019 compared to adjusted net income of $738 million or $2.67 per diluted share in 2018.  
Fourth Quarter 2019 Income Statement Highlights
In the fourth quarter of 2019, Air Canada reported EBITDA of $665 million compared to fourth quarter 2018 EBITDA of $619 million, an increase of $46 million or 7 per cent. As discussed above, the fourth quarter of 2019 was impacted by two one-time items which had the effect of reducing EBITDA by approximately $60 million. The airline reported fourth quarter 2019 operating income of $145 million compared to fourth quarter 2018 operating income of $179 million. 
In the fourth quarter of 2019, on a capacity increase of 3.3 per cent, record system passenger revenues of $3.975 billion increased $199 million or 5.3 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2018.  The increase in system passenger revenues was driven by traffic growth of 2.9 per cent and a yield improvement of 2.3 per cent. The yield improvement in the fourth quarter of 2019, particularly in North America, was in part due to the constrained capacity resulting from the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. The yield growth also reflected additional revenue from Aeroplan flight redemptions and other revenues. 
In the fourth quarter of 2019, operating expenses of $4.284 billion increased $236 million or 6 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2018. Air Canada's CASM increased 2.5 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2018. The airline's adjusted CASM increased 5.5 per cent over the fourth quarter of 2018.  These increases reflected, in large part, the impact of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft grounding which resulted in a system ASM increase of 3.3 per cent versus planned system ASM growth of approximately 4.6 per cent. The grounding also resulted in higher operating costs driven by the factors discussed in ""Full Year 2019 Income Statement Highlights"" above.  
Record fourth quarter 2019 net income amounted to $152 million or $0.56 per diluted share compared to a fourth quarter 2018 net loss of $360 million or $1.33 per diluted share. The fourth quarter of 2019 included foreign exchange gains of $92 million while the fourth quarter of 2018 included foreign exchange losses of $444 million. Air Canada reported adjusted net income(1)  of $47 million or $0.17 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to adjusted net income of $55 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2018.  
Financial and Capital Management Highlights
At December 31, 2019, unrestricted liquidity (cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investments, and undrawn lines of credit) amounted to a record $7.380 billion (December 31, 2018 – $5.725 billion).  
At December 31, 2019, net debt of $2.841 billion decreased $2.373 billion from December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investment balances of $1.694 billion and a decrease in long-term debt and lease liabilities (including current portion) of $679 million. At December 31, 2019, Air Canada's leverage ratio was 0.8, in line with the leverage ratio not exceeding 1.0 projected in Air Canada's news release dated October 29, 2019. This compares to a leverage ratio of 1.6 at December 31, 2018.
In 2019, net cash flows from operating activities of $5.712 billion increased $2.242 billion from 2018. In 2019, free cash flow(1) of $2.075 billion increased $748 million from 2018 and was higher than the free cash flow of between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion projected in Air Canada's new release dated October 29, 2019. The higher than expected free cash flow was due to a combination of factors, including higher cash from operations, a lower than projected level of capital expenditures due to certain projects being deferred to 2020, and to an initial settlement payment from Boeing as further described below.
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, return on invested capital (ROIC(1)) was 15.5 per cent, in line with the ROIC of between 15.5 per cent and 16.0 per cent projected in Air Canada's news release dated October 29, 2019. Air Canada's ROIC at December 31, 2019 was significantly higher than Air Canada's weighted average cost of capital of 7.0 per cent. 
Air Canada has been in discussions with Boeing and is seeking to settle the terms of an arrangement in relation to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Until such time as an arrangement is finalized, information regarding the outstanding purchase commitments for aircraft is subject to change. An initial settlement payment contemplated by the arrangement was made to Air Canada during the fourth quarter of 2019, with any further amounts subject to finalization of the arrangement. The compensation is accounted for as an adjustment to the purchase price of current and future deliveries and will flow through Air Canada's consolidated statement of operations as reduced depreciation expense over the life of the aircraft, and as a reduction to additions to property and equipment on the consolidated statement of cash flow. 
Normal Course Issuer Bid
In 2019, Air Canada purchased, for cancellation, a total of 9,082,487 shares at an average cost of $41.64 per share for aggregate consideration of $378 million. At December 31, 2019, a total of 17,877,551 shares remained available for repurchase under Air Canada's issuer bid which is scheduled to expire May 30, 2020.
Outlook 
In addition to the Additional Guidance and Major Assumptions noted below, Air Canada's 2020 first quarter and full year outlook in relation to both EBITDA and ASM capacity growth assumes that Air Canada's mainland China and Hong Kong services will be fully recovered by the third quarter of 2020 and that the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft will gradually return to service commencing late in the third quarter of 2020.  
First Quarter 2020
As noted above, the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft will not fly during the first quarter of 2020, as compared to 24 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft operating for the majority of the first quarter of 2019.  In addition, due to the impact of recent service suspensions to mainland China and from Toronto to Hong Kong, combined with a higher proportion of projected annual operating expense increases in both aircraft maintenance and employee benefits in the first quarter of 2020 (as described below), Air Canada expects first quarter 2020 EBITDA to be approximately $200 million lower than the first quarter of 2019.  
Full Year 2020
For the full year 2020, Air Canada projects an EBITDA margin of approximately 19 per cent, which would result in a small increase in EBITDA versus the reported EBITDA of $3.636 billion in 2019. 
For the full year 2020, Air Canada expects ASM capacity to increase 1 to 2 per cent when compared to the full year 2019. 
Additional Guidance
For the full year 2020:
Aircraft Maintenance Expense
Air Canada expects aircraft maintenance expense to increase by approximately $150 million from the full year 2019, with one-third of the increase expected to be incurred in the first quarter of 2020.  The projected increase includes the impact of additional Airbus A330 aircraft in the operating fleet (which are under power-by-the-hour arrangements) and a higher volume of engine maintenance activity year-over-year.
Employee Benefits Expense
Air Canada expects employee benefits expense to increase by approximately $105 million from the full year 2019, with one-third of the increase expected to be incurred in the first quarter of 2020. The projected increase is mainly driven by lower discount rates related to pension and post-employment benefits.
Depreciation and Amortization
Air Canada expects depreciation and amortization expense to increase by approximately $35 million from the full year 2019. The projected increase primarily reflects aircraft acquisitions.  
Major Assumptions
In addition to the above assumptions relating to the return to service of Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and the recovery of Air Canada's mainland China and Hong Kong services, Air Canada is making the following assumptions in preparing and making forward-looking statements. As part of its 2020 assumptions, Air Canada assumes:

Modest Canadian GDP growth for the first quarter and full year 2020. 
That the Canadian dollar will trade, on average, at C$1.33 per U.S. dollar in the first quarter and for full year 2020. 
That the price of jet fuel will average 71 CAD cents per litre in the first quarter and 74 CAD cents for the full year 2020. 
That six of 12 undelivered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft originally scheduled for delivery in 2019 will be delivered in 2020 with the remaining six delivered in 2021, and that 14 undelivered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft originally scheduled for delivery in 2020 will be delivered in 2021. 

The assumptions related to the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and the recovery of the mainland China and Hong Kong businesses also apply to the 2021 financial guidance discussed below.  
Investor Day Targets
The financial guidance provided in Air Canada's news release dated February 28, 2019 for 2021 with respect to annual EBITDA margin and annual ROIC, as well as the cumulative free cash flow over the 2019-2021 period, remains in place. The targets are as follows:

Annual EBITDA margin of 19 to 22 percent 
Annual ROIC of 16 to 20 percent 
Cumulative free cash flow of $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion over the 2019 to 2021 period(As noted above, Air Canada generated free cash flow of $2.075 billion in 2019.)

It is premature to assess what the impact of Air Canada's planned acquisition of Transat A.T. would be, and it is therefore not factored into Air Canada's guidance.  
The outlook provided constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws and is based on a number of assumptions (including those provided above) and subject to a number of risks. Please see the section below entitled ""Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information"".
(1) Non-GAAP Measures
Below is a description of certain non-GAAP financial measures used by Air Canada to provide readers with additional information on its financial and operating performance. Such measures are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Readers are advised to review the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Air Canada's 2019 MD&A for a further discussion of such non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of such measures to Canadian GAAP.

Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share – diluted are used by Air Canada as a means to assess the overall financial performance of its business without the after-tax effects of foreign exchange gains or losses, net financing expense relating to employee benefits, gains or losses on financial instruments recorded at fair value, gains or losses on sale and leaseback of assets, gains or losses on debt settlements and modifications, gains or losses on disposal of assets, and special items as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 
Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) is used by Air Canada to assess the overall pre-tax financial performance of its business without the effects of foreign exchange gains or losses, net financing expense relating to employee benefits, gains or losses on financial instruments recorded at fair value, gains or losses on sale and leaseback of assets, gains or losses on debt settlements and modifications, gains or losses on disposal of assets, and special items as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. Air Canada uses adjusted pre-tax income (loss) before interest to determine return on invested capital. 
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to view operating results before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as these costs can vary significantly among airlines due to differences in the way airlines finance their aircraft and other assets. Air Canada excludes special items from EBITDA as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 
Adjusted CASM is used by Air Canada as a means to assess the operating and cost performance of its on-going airline business without the effects of aircraft fuel expense, the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations®, the operating costs of Aeroplan during its initial year of acquisition, and special items as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. In calculating adjusted CASM, aircraft fuel expense is excluded from operating expense results as it fluctuates widely depending on many factors, including international market conditions, geopolitical events, jet fuel refining costs and Canada/U.S. currency exchange rates. Air Canada also incurs expenses related to ground packages at Air Canada Vacations which some airlines, without comparable tour operator businesses, may not incur. In addition, these costs do not generate ASMs and therefore excluding these costs from operating expense results provides for a more meaningful comparison across periods when such costs may vary.Excluding aircraft fuel expense, the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations and special items from operating expenses generally allows for a more meaningful analysis of Air Canada's operating expense performance and a more meaningful comparison to that of other airlines. Following the completion of Air Canada's acquisition of Aeroplan on January 10, 2019, Air Canada began consolidating Aeroplan's results. Given that the Aeroplan loyalty business was not consolidated in Air Canada's financial results in 2018, for a more meaningful comparison of the cost performance of the on-going airline business, Air Canada's adjusted CASM for 2019 excludes the operating expenses of Aeroplan. 
""Leverage ratio"" refers to net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA leverage ratio and is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to measure financial leverage. Leverage ratio is calculated by dividing net debt by trailing 12-month EBITDA (excluding special items). As mentioned above, Air Canada excludes special items from EBITDA results (which are used to determine leverage ratio) as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 
Free cash flow is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as an indicator of the financial strength and performance of its business, indicating the amount of cash Air Canada is able to generate from operations and after capital expenditures. Free cash flow is calculated as net cash flows from operating activities minus additions to property, equipment and intangible assets, and is net of proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions. Free cash flow in 2019 also excludes the one-time proceeds related to the Aeroplan acquisition. 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is used by Air Canada as a means to assess the efficiency with which it allocates its capital to generate returns. ROIC is based on adjusted pre-tax income (loss), excluding interest expense. Invested capital includes average year-over-year long-term debt, average year-over-year lease obligations, average year-over-year shareholders' equity, net of excess cash. Air Canada defines excess cash as total cash and investments in excess of the minimum cash required to support operations. This measure of liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term restricted cash and long-term investments. Air Canada uses 20 per cent of trailing 12 months operating revenue as its estimate of the minimum cash required to support on-going business operations. This estimate of minimum cash provides adequate coverage for advance ticket sales and to meet Air Canada's liquidity needs. Air Canada calculates invested capital based on a book value-based method of calculating ROIC, as described above. Refer to the definition of adjusted pre-tax income (loss) for a discussion as to why Air Canada uses adjusted pre-tax income (loss) to assess the overall pre-tax financial performance of its business.

Air Canada's 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and its 2019 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition are available on Air Canada's website at aircanada.com and will be filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

MONTREAL, Feb. 6, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has introduced a new payment option for customers by enabling them to use PayPal when purchasing tickets online at aircanada.com in Canada. The popular online payment system offers a secure and convenient means to buy tickets, with customers able to pay for their flights with their preferred payment method – bank account, credit cards or Visa Debit card – linked to their PayPal account. 
""Air Canada's strategy is to continually provide customers the opportunity to make their purchase using their preferred method of payment. We are therefore pleased to announce our agreement with PayPal, the popular online payment system that is secure, fast and convenient to use. Having now made PayPal available for ticket sales in Canada, we will look to expand the program to other markets as opportunities arise,"" said Keith Wallis, Senior Director, Payments and Distribution, at Air Canada.
""We're excited to add Air Canada—our first airline partner in Canada—to a growing fleet of airlines across the globe that leverage our global e-commerce platform to expand their reach,"" said Paul Parisi, PayPal Canada President. ""Our two companies share the same goal to provide a great checkout experience for travellers, so they spend less time buying tickets online and more time enjoying their trip.""
PayPal has more than 300 million active users worldwide.

MONTREAL, Jan. 29, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that following the Government of Canada's Advisory to avoid non-essential travel to mainland China it is temporarily suspending all direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai effective January 30, 2020 until February 29, 2020.

Share this article














































MONTREAL, Jan. 22, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today said that it has now removed the Boeing 737 MAX from its operating schedule until June 30, 2020. The decision is based on operational considerations following an announcement by Boeing Co. that it now estimates the 737 MAX will remain grounded by regulators until mid-2020.
Air Canada is removing the Boeing 737 MAX from its operating scheduled to provide customers certainty when planning and booking their travel. It will also allow the airline to manage its schedule and fleet most effectively as it awaits decisions by Canadian and international regulators on returning the 737 MAX safely into service. Customers affected by these changes will be advised of their new itineraries and offered suitable travel options.
In compliance with a safety notice closing Canadian airspace issued by Transport Canada on March 13, 2019, Air Canada grounded its fleet of 24 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Final decisions on returning the 737 MAX to service will be based on Air Canada's safety assessment following the lifting of government safety notices and requisite approvals by the FAA and Transport Canada.

MONTREAL, Jan. 15, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today unveiled the newest member of its fleet, the Airbus A220-300, before employees and special guests at the airline's Montreal headquarters. Built in Mirabel, Quebec, the Bombardier-designed aircraft continues Air Canada's fleet modernization. The A220's state-of-the-art design and cabin is destined to be extremely popular with customers, and this new aircraft will also help Air Canada reduce its carbon footprint through a 20 per cent reduction in fuel consumption per seat.

Airbus A220 – Factsheet (CNW Group/Air Canada)














""This is an historic moment for Air Canada as we welcome the Airbus A220 into our fleet. We are the first airline in Canada to operate this next-generation aircraft, which was designed by Bombardier in Mirabel, Quebec. Our customers will enjoy a level of comfort unrivalled on a single-aisle aircraft and the A220's operating efficiencies promise meaningful environmental and cost benefits. The arrival of the first of our order of 45 A220s, with a list price value of US$3.8 billion at the time it was made, underscores our contribution to Canada's aerospace industry and its economy,"" said Calin Rovinescu, Air Canada's President and Chief Executive Officer.


""I am especially pleased today given Air Canada's role in completing the 2016 order for the C Series, as it was then called, at a time when the future of this aircraft program was in doubt. We are very proud to have paved the way for orders from other major carriers,"" said Mr. Rovinescu. 
""Airbus is very proud to be celebrating with our longstanding customer Air Canada, as they add their first A220 to their fleet. Airbus has been in Canada for over 35 years, and today we are becoming even more Canadian as passengers from Canada are about to discover a brand new flying experience on board this state-of-the art Canadian-designed and built aircraft. Congratulations to everyone at Air Canada and to the Airbus Canada team in Mirabel for this fantastic achievement. We look forward to continuing to develop our partnership with Air Canada for the years to come,"" said Philippe Balducchi, CEO, Airbus Canada Limited Partnership and Head of Country Canada for Airbus.A220 Opens Up New Opportunities for Air CanadaPassengers will be welcomed aboard the A220-300 on January 16, 2020, on its maiden commercial flight between Montreal and Calgary. As more A220s enter the fleet, the aircraft will be initially deployed from Montreal and Toronto on existing Canadian and transborder routes such as to Ottawa, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton and New York – La Guardia.The first two new A220 routes for Air Canada begin May 4, 2020 with the launch of Montreal-Seattle and Toronto-San Jose, California service, the only non-stop service between these city pairs. ""The A220 will allow Air Canada to further strengthen our position on transborder and transcontinental markets and be instrumental in our continued growth. The A220 will allow us to further expand our North American network, offering customers new routes and more robust year-round schedules. When connecting through our hubs across Canada onward to international destinations, customers travelling on an A220 will benefit from a virtually seamless cabin experience offering a comparable level of service and comforts as on a widebody aircraft,"" said Mark Galardo, Vice President of Network Planning at Air Canada.About the Air Canada A220-300Air Canada's first Airbus A220-300 was built at Airbus Canada's (previously Bombardier) Mirabel facility employing close to 2,700 people. Each A220 includes parts from 30 Canadian suppliers. Air Canada has firm orders for 45 A220s, with a total list price value of US$3.8 billion for the order at the time it was made, all of which are to be built at Mirabel.Air Canada will be the first North American carrier to operate the larger A220-300 version of the aircraft, which has a range of 3,200 nautical miles.The two-class cabin has 137 seats: 12 in a 2x2 configuration in Business Class and 125 in a 3x2 layout for Economy passengers. Customers will have more personal space thanks to the widest economy seats in the fleet at 19 inches, and the largest overhead stowage bins for an aircraft this size.Additional features include larger windows and full-colour LED ambient and customizable mood lighting that contribute to reducing fatigue while travelling. The high ceilings, extra shoulder room and storage make this an unparalleled interior in the narrow-body segment. Every seat on the A220 features a Panasonic in-flight entertainment system with content available in 15 languages and featuring more than 1,000 hours of high-quality entertainment, including content from Bell Media's premium entertainment service, Crave, and Montreal-based multi-platform audio service, Stingray. The system also offers dynamic closed captioning for the deaf and is accessible to the visually impaired. The A220 will also have satellite-based, high speed Wi-Fi access.The A220 will also further Air Canada's environmental commitment, with engines projected to yield a 20 per cent reduction in fuel consumption per seat.

Air Canada’s Calin Rovinescu to be Inducted Into 2020 Canadian Business Hall of Fame (CNW Group/Air Canada)

















""Calin's exceptional business and leadership achievements have been widely recognized by several influential organizations both in Canada and globally. His deep commitment to making Canada a better place begins with his relentless determination and long-term vision in creating a sustainable, continually improving global company, which becomes a solid foundation to giving back to society. Through Calin's oversight of Air Canada's initiatives in championing diversity, mentorship to youth, investing in future technologies to reduce environment impact, advancing charitable programs that focus on helping children and improving children's health, plus his personal contributions to educational scholarships and through his role as University of Ottawa's Chancellor, it is most fitting that his accomplishments in business excellence and contributions to Canadian social causes have earned Calin another top honour as an inductee into the 2020 Canadian Business Hall of Fame,"" said Annette Verschuren, Member of the Air Canada Board of Directors, and a 2019 Canadian Business Hall of Fame Inductee.

Mr. Rovinescu has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada since April 1, 2009. Among the many recognitions for his business accomplishments, he was recently named CEO of the Year and Strategist of the Year (2019), awarded the Executive Leadership Award at the 2018 Airline Strategy Awards, named Canada's Outstanding CEO of the Year (2016) and Canada's Best CEO (2013). He is a member of the Board of Directors of BCE Inc. and Bell Canada, and of the Business Council of Canada, and is the 14th Chancellor of the University of Ottawa.
The Canadian Business Hall of Fame celebrates the outstanding achievements of Canada's most distinguished business leaders, past and present.  It was established by JA Canada in 1979 to honour Canada's pre-eminent business leaders for their professional and philanthropic achievements.  Companions are nominated by their peers and are chosen by an independent selection committee. About Air Canada Air Canada is Canada's largest domestic and international airline serving nearly 220 airports on six continents. Canada's flag carrier is among the 20 largest airlines in the world and in 2018 served nearly 51 million customers. Air Canada provides scheduled passenger service directly to 62 airports in Canada, 53 in the United States and 101 in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and South America. Air Canada is a founding member of Star Alliance, the world's most comprehensive air transportation network serving 1,250 airports in 195 countries. Air Canada is the only international network carrier in North America to receive a Four-Star ranking according to independent U.K. research firm Skytrax, which also named Air Canada the 2019 Best Airline in North America.

Airline features three children from a plane full of kids with different challenges in a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAjJxgVEH0I&feature=youtu.be 
MONTREAL, Dec. 18, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today unveiled a heartwarming video featuring three children from a plane full of kids with different challenges called Every Kid Deserves a Day Off. Thanks to the numerous Air Canada employee volunteers, support of the Air Canada Foundation and the work by the Dreams Take Flight organization, eight flights operate annually and in 2019, transported over 1000 children on a trip-of-a-lifetime to Disney. Dreams Take Flight has given more than 40,000 Canadian children a Dreams flight since 1989. 



















Video: Air Canada: Every Kid Deserves a Day Off











""Air Canada has been committed to serving and giving back to Canadian communities for more than 80 years, and we're immensely proud of our ongoing affiliation with the extraordinary Dreams Take Flight since it launched more than 30 years ago. Every year, eight Dreams flights depart from cities across Canada onboard Air Canada aircraft operated by our pilots, flight attendants, maintenance engineers along with numerous other employees on the ground and behind the scenes who all donate their time for these flights. Dreams Take Flight is a powerful example of our employees generously giving their time to help children forget their challenges for one day and just be kids,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer at Air Canada.




""We salute the volunteers for their unwavering support and tireless work in making each Dreams flight memorable and magical for every child onboard. Together, we continue to make a positive difference in the lives of thousands of children across Canada,"" said Priscille LeBlanc, Chair of the Air Canada Foundation.
""We've seen how one special day leaves each child with lasting memories,"" said Bev Watson, President of Dreams Take Flight Canada. ""Air Canada volunteer crews host the children onboard, giving their days off to help children get theirs. The dreams made reality by our program would not be possible without them and the decades of support from Air Canada and the Air Canada Foundation. The experience is magical and helps children see new possibilities."" Dreams Take Flight is a non-profit primarily made up of current and retired Air Canada employees who volunteer to make these flights a reality. Each year, the organization provides once-in-a-lifetime trips from eight cities across Canada for kids who may be facing mental, physical or social challenges, giving them a break from their everyday. Over the past 30 years, Air Canada, as exclusive carrier and now through the Air Canada Foundation, has flown more than forty thousand children on Dreams Take Flight trips. Visit dreamstakeflight.ca to donate or volunteer.About Every Kid Deserves a Day Off The video begins with an awe-inspiring, early morning send-off for the kids at a specially-decorated Air Canada aircraft hangar, followed by a peek at the in-flight fun with airline employees. Also featured are three young Canadians, Ariane, Jardie and Trent, who talk about the significance of the trip to them. Their moving stories highlight the importance of the program in giving children time away from their challenging daily lives to follow their dreams, have fun, and just be kids for the day.Who's who? Ariane: Charming and friendly, eight-year-old Ariane was born with a congenital heart defect. She had her first operation at two months old and will likely need two more surgeries later in life. Ariane must monitor her health on a daily basis and misses school regularly for doctor's visits. The Dreams Take Flight trip offers Ariane a chance to forget about medical appointments for a day and spend time with other kids.Jardie: Eleven-year-old Jardie is a sweet little girl living with Down syndrome. Jardie has trouble communicating verbally and does not always feel understood. Because of her developmental challenges, she must closely follow her parents' and educators' instructions and guidance. For Jardie, the Dreams Take Flight trip is a chance to forget the rules and to have a day just for herself. Trent: The youngest of seven siblings, nine-year-old Trent lives with Cystic Fibrosis, a respiratory disease requiring regular hospital visits and daily treatments with specialized equipment. It also means Trent may one day need a lung transplant. Despite this, Trent remains brave and energetic. The Dreams Take Flight trip is a wonderful opportunity for him to trade treatment for a lifetime of memories.  The video, which appears in 80-, 60- and 15-second versions, will be distributed across Canada via the airline's social media and digital platforms from December 18 to January 3.About Dreams Take FlightDreams Take Flight is a national non-profit organization dedicated to providing the trip of a lifetime to children who may be physically, mentally or socially challenged. With the aid of Air Canada, the Air Canada Foundation and other national and local organizations and businesses, money is raised to fund the program in Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa and Halifax. Funds not required for its primary purpose can be gifted by Dreams Take Flight to other registered charities that benefit physically, mentally or socially challenged children and are within the policies adopted by Dreams Take Flight Canada. The first Dreams Take Flight station was founded in Toronto in 1989. Since then, the organization has taken over 40,000 special children to Florida and California. About the Air Canada FoundationThe Air Canada Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on the health and well-being of children and youth, was launched in 2012. It offers both financial and in-kind support to Canadian registered charities. Core programs include the Hospital Transportation Program, which donates Aeroplan Miles to 15 pediatric hospitals across Canada, enabling sick children to access the medical care they need but which are unavailable locally. The Air Canada Foundation, in collaboration with the airline, also engages directly in fundraising activities, such as the Every Bit Counts program, which encourages Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge customers to donate loose change of all denominations aboard flights or through collection containers available in Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounges. The Foundation also offers continued support to major health-related causes that benefit Canadians and is an active participant in international humanitarian relief activity as the need arises.

Air Canada’s inaugural flight AC51, 787 Dreamliner service which departed last night from Vancouver has arrived in Auckland, marking the carrier’s launch of seasonal service between Canada and New Zealand. (CNW Group/Air Canada)











""We are excited to launch our newest South Pacific route to Auckland which offers additional opportunities for North Americans travelling to enjoy New Zealand's summer season, and for New Zealanders travelling for a Canadian winter vacation. Our Auckland flights are timed to conveniently connect at our extensive Vancouver trans-Pacific hub to and from a multitude of non-stop destinations throughout North America including New York-Newark,"" said Mark Galardo, Vice President, Network Planning at Air Canada.




""We are very excited to welcome this new service from Air Canada which further connects Vancouver to Auckland using the amazing Dreamliner aircraft,"" said Craig Richmond, President and CEO, Vancouver Airport Authority. ""This addition to Air Canada's growing network at Vancouver International Airport will not only open up more business and travel opportunities in Canada and New Zealand, it will also facilitate valuable connecting traffic between the two airports. We appreciate Air Canada's continued commitment to utilizing Vancouver as their trans-Pacific hub."" 
""We're proud of the contribution this new service will make to growing travel and trade between the two countries. The seamless connections Air Canada provides through its hub in Vancouver will further promote a growing market. In 2018 alone, Canadians choosing to holiday in New Zealand grew by 6.7 percent to 70,000 visitors. Similarly, New Zealand visitor numbers grew by an impressive 12 percent with 34,000 people visiting Canada during the same period,"" said Scott Tasker, General Manager of Aeronautical Commercial at Auckland Airport.""Canada is one of New Zealand's closest international partners. The new Air Canada non-stop service between Vancouver and Auckland will contribute to strengthening our close connections, further increasing our people-to-people links and tourism links,"" said Amy Tisdall, New Zealand's chargée d'affaires.""I'm thrilled that Air Canada will be offering direct flights from Auckland to Vancouver. B.C. is a sought-after destination for international visitors, with Vancouver International Airport as the gateway to exploring our beautiful province. And now, with the HSBC Canada Sevens set to take place in Vancouver for another four years, this is the perfect time for rugby fans from around the world to visit B.C. To our friends in New Zealand, we say Kia Ora!"" said Lisa Beare, British Columbia's Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture.Air Canada's state-of-the-art Boeing 787-8* Dreamliners feature 20 Signature Class lie-flat seats, 21 Premium Economy and 214 Economy Class seats with upgraded in-flight entertainment at every seat throughout the aircraft. All Air Canada flights provide for Aeroplan accumulation and redemption and, for eligible customers, access to priority services, Maple Leaf Lounges and other benefits.

""We are very pleased to celebrate the historic start of non-stop service between Montreal and Brazil, marked by the launch of our newest international flight to São Paulo. Complementing our Toronto services, our new flights from Montreal provide another convenient link to Brazil's largest city and financial centre while offering a great opportunity for Brazilians to enjoy an exceptional Quebec winter vacation. São Paulo is one of 13 new international destinations added by Air Canada from Montreal-Trudeau Airport since 2017, further reinforcing our ongoing transformation of Montreal into a competitive, international hub. The Montreal-Brazil route also underscores Air Canada's strategic expansion to South America, with new flights that launched from Toronto to Quito on December 8, and starting next summer, from Montreal to Bogota,"" said Mark Galardo, Vice President, Network Planning at Air Canada.

Flights will be operated by Air Canada's flagship Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner with a 298-seat configuration featuring Air Canada Signature Class, Premium Economy and Economy Class service, with high-definition individual on-demand entertainment offering a wide range of movies, short films, TV programs and audio selections at every seat throughout the aircraft.  
Additionally, award-winning Montreal Chef Antonio Park's menu creations with a South American inspiration are presented as a dining choice in Signature Class. His menu options will also be available at the Montreal International Maple Leaf Lounge as well as in the Toronto-São Paulo Signature Class flights.""We are very pleased to welcome the new route to Sao Paulo, a major economic and industrial hub for business travellers. We have been waiting a long time to be able to offer this destination to our passengers,"" said Philippe Rainville, President and CEO of Aéroports de Montréal. ""Thanks to our major partner, Air Canada, YUL Montréal-Trudeau International Airport is continuing to strengthen its role as an international air traffic hub and enhance its air service to South America.""""The Government of Québec congratulates Air Canada and Aéroports de Montréal, as well as the public and private partners concerned, on the establishment of this new direct air link between Montréal and São Paulo. I am convinced that it will help strengthen relations between Quebec and Brazil, Quebec's largest trading partner and largest customer in South America, as well as with the State of São Paulo, where Quebec has had a representative office for more than 10 years,"" said Nadine Girault, Minister of International Relations and Francophonie.""The Government of Québec salutes this new direct link between Québec and Brazil, which will undoubtedly attract growing numbers of Brazilians to Québec. Brazil has the world's 10th largest pool of tourists and Québec stands out more than ever as a world-class destination with its unique tourism offerings, authentic experiences and four distinct seasons. The link is thus a promising one, an additional bridge between our two nations that opens a new chapter for our tourism industry and our economy. With the new Explore Québec program promoting accessibility throughout our vast territory, all of Québec's regions will benefit from this new link,"" said Caroline Proulx, Québec's Minister of Tourism.""Brazil is Quebec's largest trading partner in Latin America. This new direct flight to Sao Paulo, a major economic and industrial hub, will facilitate growth of Montreal's businesses in this market, which offers significant commercial opportunities in key industry sectors such as advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence and aerospace. The Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal congratulates Air Canada for its leadership to enhance Montreal's status as a global hub for air travel, and its commitment in the city's international expansion,"" said Michel Leblanc, President and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal.""As Brazil recorded a 38 per cent increase in arrivals to Québec in 2017, the Alliance welcomes the launch of a new Montréal‒São-Paulo nonstop direct flight. This initiative supports the current efforts to position Québec as a travel destination to markets in South America, while reflecting positively on our industry's seasonality. The Brazilian visitor is particularly fond of our winters, our wide-open spaces and our local flavours. The Alliance acknowledges Air Canada's commitment in launching this direct international nonstop flight to Québec. Accessibility is a determining factor when pursuing vigorous growth on the international visitor market ‒ in turn, it generates major economic spin-offs for the entire destination,"" said Martin Soucy, Chief Executive Officer at the l'Alliance de l'industrie touristique du Québec.""This new flight to Sao Paolo is excellent news for Montreal, which reaffirms its position as a major hub for international destinations. The entire ecosystem under Tourisme Montréal's mandate salutes the efforts made by Air Canada to improve the accessibility of our destination. We intend to work closely with our partners to ensure the success of this new route,"" said Yves Lalumière, President and CEO of Tourisme Montréal.""The addition of direct flights plays a key role in the attractiveness of the region. This new connection between our two world class cities will surely generate new business opportunities and deepen our economic and commercial ties,"" said Christian Bernard, Chief Economist and Vice President, Economic Affairs and Marketing Communication at Montréal International, greater Montreal's economic promotion agency.The schedule is timed for convenient connections across Air Canada's network in North America, including to and from Vancouver, Calgary and Quebec City, New York and Boston, as well as to and from several Brazilian cities beyond São Paulo.All flights provide for Aeroplan accumulation and redemption, Star Alliance reciprocal benefits and, for eligible customers, priority check-in, Maple Leaf Lounge access at Air Canada's Montreal hub, priority boarding and other benefits.

“Air Canada offers the most flights for travel between Canada and France and we are increasing our services to build on our market leading position. From our major hubs in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, we are scheduled to operate up to 53 non-stop flights per week to a total of six destinations in France for summer 2020,"" said Mark Galardo, Vice President of Network Planning at Air Canada.

These added flights will also allow customers additional flexibility of choosing their preferred departure time from the city of lights, as Air Canada will introduce an early evening departure from Paris to both Montreal and Toronto.""


The additional flights will be operated with Air Canada's Airbus A330-300 fleet, featuring Signature Class, including lie flat suites in business and Air Canada Signature Service, Premium Economy and Economy cabins.

""I am very pleased that Air Canada has been named the 2019 Airline of The Year by Global Traveler. The success we have had transforming our airline into a leading global carrier is being recognized worldwide and we continue to invest in new aircraft, onboard services, airport amenities and a new Loyalty program to build on our leading position. Mostly, however, this award recognizes the hard work of our employees and their commitment to deliver customer service excellence every day, for which I thank them,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive of Air Canada. 


Global Traveler's staff submitted nominations to an advisory board, whose members chose the winners based on a series of factors after thorough research. The panel weighed the nominees' financial data, safety records, product offerings, onboard menus and overall image as a brand before selecting Air Canada as Airline of The Year. 
Since 2010, Air Canada has embarked on a $12 Billion capital expenditure program to elevate the travel experience which has included:
An expanded global network connecting over its Canadian gateway hubs to nearly 220 cities in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and North and South America. Air Canada is one of only a few airlines in the world to serve all six inhabited continents; 
A wide body fleet renewal program that introduced Boeing 777s and state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliners and that includes a significant refurbishment of the A330 fleet to the Dream cabin; 
A narrow body fleet renewal which continues this month with the delivery of the airline's first Airbus A220-300 aircraft; 
Best in class cabin interiors across its wide-body fleet, featuring lie-flat direct aisle access Signature Class seats and a Premium Economy cabin offering increased pitch and width; 
Signature Class Service internationally and year-round on select North America transcontinental flights including between Toronto and Vancouver, San Francisco, and Los Angeles; Montreal and Vancouver; and Vancouver and New York (Newark). Signature Class features an end-to-end premium travel experience with exclusive services and amenities; 
BMW Chauffeur Service for select customers connecting to international flights at the Toronto global hub; 
New international, domestic and U.S. Maple Leaf Lounge concepts, including the Air Canada Signature Suite for eligible customers travelling in Signature Class internationally from the Toronto Pearson global hub, featuring a la carte dining with a menu created by celebrated Canadian Chef David Hawksworth; and the Air Canada Café, a first in North America, where eligible customers departing on a domestic flight from Toronto-Pearson can enjoy a premium coffee shop experience with grab and go snacks. 
Enhanced onboard amenities such as signature dishes prepared by Canadian celebrity chefs David Hawksworth, Antonio Park and Vikram Vij, coupled with wine pairings by world-renowned sommelier Veronique Rivest; a revamped Skyriders program with special amenities for the youngest travellers and families; in-flight Wi-fi connectivity on all narrow-body aircraft, and progressive implementation onboard the wide-body fleet, complementing Air Canada's personal seatback in-flight entertainment system, which offers more than 1,000 hours of free digital audio-visual content. 
Ongoing customer service training initiatives for customer-facing in-flight, airport, baggage and call centre employees; 
Technological innovations to facilitate customer interactions, including a new website compatible with all types of devices for a consistent experience, ongoing refinements of mobile technology, and increased investments in artificial intelligence to further develop customer-focused capabilities and information management;
This win builds on other recent accolades such as being named Best Airline in North America for the third consecutive year at the 2019 Skytrax World Airline Awards, as well as the Best Airline for Family Travel by the Wherever Awards and the Favourite Airline for Millennial Travellers by the Trazee Awards. Air Canada was also named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers (2020) for the seventh consecutive year and was recognized for Diversity in Leadership at the 2019 Airline Strategy Awards.About Air Canada Air Canada is Canada's largest domestic and international airline serving nearly 220 airports on six continents.

MONTREAL, Nov. 15, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has launched a next generation Air Canada mobile app, now available for download on iOS and Android. Designed with customers at the center, the new app features an intuitive layout supported by the latest technologies, to deliver faster, more reliable performance. 










All-New Air Canada App Features Intuitive Design, Faster Experience and Additional Features (CNW Group/Air Canada)










""Air Canada is focused on making travel easier and more comfortable for everyone, particularly through the use of the latest technologies. Beyond the new features launching today, such as interactive airport maps with turn-by-turn directions for travellers, the new app provides the foundation necessary for future developments, most notably the launch of our new Loyalty program in 2020,"" said Mark Nasr, Vice President, Loyalty and eCommerce at Air Canada. ""The app was designed and built entirely in Canada, in our Digital labs enabled by the Air Canada technology team.""


From booking to boarding with one hand, the Air Canada mobile app is the ultimate travel assistant. It was developed after extensive consultation with customers and employees around the world, including the more than 18,000 flyers who participated in the Beta program. 
Among its many features, in a first for a Canadian airline, the new app will display interactive airport maps of Toronto Pearson International Airport, Montreal Trudeau International Airport, and Vancouver International Airport. These detailed indoor maps will guide customers through flight connections, and help customers find gates, restaurants, restrooms, and the closest Air Canada lounge, along with estimated walking times. Other notable features include real-time upgrade/standby lists, inbound flight tracking, downloadable boarding passes and automatic flight notifications. The app also supports Aeroplan profile sign-in with expedited ticket purchase and check-in. Updates to the app will rollout regularly, including releases that will work seamlessly with Aeroplan loyalty accounts, among other improvements. About Air Canada Air Canada is Canada's largest domestic and international airline serving nearly 220 airports on six continents. Canada's flag carrier is among the 20 largest airlines in the world and in 2018 served nearly 51 million customers.

Air Canada Reports Third Quarter 2019 Results

Record third quarter operating revenues of $5.553 billion 
Operating income of $956 million 
EBITDA of $1.472 billion, up 9 per cent over the prior year's third quarter 
Record unrestricted liquidity of $7.355 billion and leverage ratio of 0.8

MONTREAL, Oct. 29, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today reported third quarter 2019 EBITDA(1) (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment) of $1.472 billion compared to third quarter 2018 EBITDA of $1.351 billion, an increase of $121 million or 9 per cent. The airline reported third quarter 2019 operating income of $956 million compared to third quarter 2018 operating income of $923 million.  
""I am pleased to report an excellent third quarter for Air Canada, in which we generated record operating revenues of close to $5.6 billion and reached record liquidity of nearly $7.4 billion. Impressive as such strong results are on their own, they are even more meaningful given that we achieved them despite the serious disruption to our operations and to our cost structure created by the Boeing 737 MAX grounding. Our record performance is a testament to the resourcefulness, skill and dedication of the entire Air Canada team, and I applaud and thank them for their hard work taking care of our customers since the Boeing 737 MAX grounding occurred,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada. 
""During the quarter, our airline delivered on key metrics. This included EBITDA of $1.472 billion, an increase of 9 per cent from the previous year, higher operating income, and improved yields. Our leverage ratio(1) was 0.8 at the quarter's end, a decrease of 50 per cent from December 31, 2018. The significant progress we have made on our balance sheet was recognized in the third quarter and, earlier this year, by upgrades from major debt rating agencies, advancing us to one level below our goal of investment grade status.
""Through great effort and teamwork, we have successfully managed through the extremely challenging 737 MAX grounding for nearly eight months now, most recently adjusting our schedule to remove the aircraft until February 14, 2020 and wet leasing two Airbus A330 aircraft to ensure we have sufficient capacity this winter. However, the removal of a scheduled 36 737 MAX aircraft during our peak summer season exacted a toll from a financial, route, product, and human resources perspective and the grounding is preventing us from realizing our full potential,"" said Mr. Rovinescu.
""I nonetheless remain confident that if regulators unground the aircraft near-term, our on-going transformation will quickly regain its previous trajectory. For this reason, we have chosen at this time not to adjust our long-term financial targets presented at our last Investor Day. Much of my confidence flows from the professionalism our employees have demonstrated throughout this year since the aircraft was grounded, as well as the strong loyalty shown by our customers, and I thank both groups for their commitment to and support of Air Canada.
""As well, we were extremely pleased to see that during the third quarter Transat A.T. shareholders approved the definitive acquisition agreement with Air Canada, by a vote of nearly 95 per cent. This overwhelmingly favourable vote underscores the numerous benefits for all stakeholders from the proposed merger, which now remains subject to applicable regulatory approvals and customary conditions.""
Third Quarter Income Statement Highlights
Air Canada began consolidating Aeroplan's financial results on the date of the acquisition of Aeroplan, January 10, 2019. Air Canada adopted accounting standard IFRS 16 - Leases effective January 1, 2019 and restated 2018 amounts (including for period-over-period comparisons).
On a capacity reduction of 2.1 per cent, record third quarter system passenger revenues of $5.164 billion increased $146 million or 2.9 per cent from the same quarter in 2018. The increase in system passenger revenues was driven by a yield improvement of 4.8 per cent, partly offset by a traffic decrease of 1.8 per cent. System yield in the third quarter of 2019 improved due to the constrained capacity resulting from the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft as well as a generally improved pricing environment, mainly in North America. The yield increases also included additional revenues from Aeroplan flight redemptions and other revenues subsequent to the Aeroplan acquisition on January 10, 2019.  
In the third quarter of 2019, operating expenses of $4.597 billion increased $105 million or 2 per cent from the third quarter of 2018. Air Canada's cost per available seat mile (CASM) increased 4.5 per cent from the third quarter of 2018. The airline's adjusted CASM(1) increased 9.3 per cent over the same quarter in 2018. These increases reflected, in large part, the impact of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft grounding which resulted in a system ASM decline of 2.1 per cent versus planned system ASM growth of approximately 3 per cent, in addition to creating higher costs associated with replacement aircraft, and on-going operating expenses, including depreciation and pilot wages, that continued to be incurred in relation to the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft despite their grounding. Given that the Aeroplan loyalty business was not consolidated in Air Canada's financial results in 2018, for a more meaningful comparison of the cost performance of the on-going airline business, Air Canada's adjusted CASM for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 excludes the operating expenses of Aeroplan.
Air Canada's third quarter EBITDA of $1.472 billion was 9 per cent higher than the third quarter of 2018, and better than the increase of approximately 5 per cent projected in Air Canada's news release dated July 30, 2019. This better than expected EBITDA performance was primarily driven by a lower fuel price per litre than what Air Canada had previously assumed in its guidance.
Third quarter 2019 net income amounted to $636 million or $2.35 per diluted share compared to third quarter 2018 net income of $702 million or $2.55 per diluted share. The third quarter of 2019 included foreign exchange gains of $27 million while the third quarter of 2018 included foreign exchange gains of $145 million. Air Canada reported adjusted net income(1)  of $613 million or $2.27 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2019 compared to adjusted net income of $580 million or $2.10 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018.  
Financial and Capital Management Highlights
At September 30, 2019, unrestricted liquidity (cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investments, and undrawn lines of credit) amounted to a record $7.355 billion (September 30, 2018 – $5.309 billion).  
At September 30, 2019, net debt of $2.999 billion decreased $2.215 billion from December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investment balances of $1.654 billion and a decrease in long-term debt and lease liabilities of $561 million. At September 30, 2019, Air Canada's leverage ratio was 0.8 versus a ratio of 1.6 at December 31, 2018.
Net cash flows from operating activities of $834 million increased $284 million from the third quarter of 2018. In the third quarter of 2019, free cash flow(1) of $533 million decreased $64 million from the third quarter of 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, Air Canada received proceeds of $293 million from the sale and leaseback of 25 Embraer aircraft while no such proceeds were received in the third quarter of 2019. In the third quarter of 2019, the increase in cash flows from operating activities over the third quarter of 2018 was partly offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $55 million. Excess cash amounted to $2.683 billion at September 30, 2019. Refer to section 6.1 ""Liquidity"" of Air Canada's Third Quarter 2019 MD&A for additional information on excess cash.
For the 12 months ended September 30, 2019, return on invested capital (ROIC(1)) was 15.5 per cent, significantly higher than Air Canada's weighted average cost of capital of 7.2 per cent. 
Normal Course Issuer Bid
In the third quarter of 2019, Air Canada purchased, for cancellation, a total of 2,111,800 shares at an average cost of $43.15 per share for aggregate consideration of $91 million (6,426,287 shares at an average cost of $38.87 per share for aggregate consideration of $250 million for the first nine months of 2019). At September 30, 2019, a total of 20,533,751 shares remained available for repurchase under Air Canada's issuer bid which is scheduled to expire May 30, 2020.
Full Year 2019 Outlook and 2020-21 Investor Day Targets
As indicated in its October 16, 2019 news release, Air Canada removed Boeing 737 MAX flying from its schedule until February 14, 2020. Final decisions on returning the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to service will be based on Air Canada's safety assessment following the lifting of government safety notices and approval by regulatory authorities.  
Air Canada's projected capital expenditures, discussed in section 6.6 of Air Canada's Third Quarter 2019 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results, reflect Air Canada's assumption that the remaining 12 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft previously scheduled for delivery 2019 will now be delivered in 2020. Air Canada continues to expect the 14 737 MAX aircraft scheduled for 2020 to be delivered in 2020.
For the full year 2019, Air Canada projects the following:

EBITDA margin (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment, as a percentage of operating revenue) of approximately 19.0 per cent 
ROIC of between 15.5 per cent and 16.0 per cent 
Free cash flow of between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Free cash flow for 2019 is being positively impacted by a number of factors, including the deferral of the delivery of 12 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft from 2019 to 2020, lower capital expenditures across many different areas (mainly timing-related), a stronger working capital performance, the impact of aircraft lease extensions which defers the end of lease maintenance obligation, and the favourable impact of higher cash and investment balances on net interest expense.  
A leverage ratio not exceeding 1.0 at December 31, 2019 (measured by net debt over trailing 12-month EBITDA) 

The financial guidance provided in Air Canada's news release dated February 28, 2019 for the years 2020 and 2021 with respect to annual EBITDA margin and annual ROIC, as well as the cumulative free cash flow over the 2019-2021 period, remains in place.  
Major Assumptions
Assumptions were made by Air Canada in preparing and making forward-looking statements (including EBITDA margin, ROIC and free cash flow guidance referred to above for the years 2020 and 2021).  
As part of its assumptions, for 2019, Air Canada assumes:

Modest Canadian GDP growth for the fourth quarter and full year 
That the Canadian dollar will trade, on average, at C$1.33 per U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter and full year 
That the price of jet fuel will average 77 CAD cents per litre in the fourth quarter and full year 

Air Canada's assumptions as they pertain to the 2020-to-2021 period are provided in Air Canada's news release dated February 28, 2019. Air Canada's guidance for 2020 and 2021 also assumes the return to service of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in the first quarter of 2020.  
It is premature to assess what the impact of Air Canada's acquisition of Transat A.T. would be, and it is therefore not factored into Air Canada's guidance.  
The outlook provided constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws and is based on a number of assumptions (including those provided above) and subject to a number of risks. Please see the section below entitled ""Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information"".
(1) Non-GAAP Measures
Below is a description of certain non-GAAP measures used by Air Canada in an effort to provide readers with additional information on its financial and operating performance. Such measures are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Readers are advised to review the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Air Canada's Third Quarter 2019 MD&A for a further discussion of such non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of such measures to Canadian GAAP.

Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share – diluted are used by Air Canada as a means to assess the overall financial performance of its business without the after-tax effects of foreign exchange gains or losses, net financing expense relating to employee benefits, gains or losses on financial instruments recorded at fair value, gains or losses on sale and leaseback of assets, gains or losses on debt settlements and modifications, gains or losses on disposal of assets, and special items as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 
Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) is used by Air Canada to assess the overall pre-tax financial performance of its business without the effects of foreign exchange gains or losses, net financing expense relating to employee benefits, gains or losses on financial instruments recorded at fair value, gains or losses on sale and leaseback of assets, gains or losses on debt settlements and modifications, gains or losses on disposal of assets, and special items as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. Air Canada uses adjusted pre-tax income (loss) before interest to determine return on invested capital. 
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment) is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to view operating results before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment as these costs can vary significantly among airlines due to differences in the way airlines finance their aircraft and other assets. Air Canada excludes special items from EBITDA as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 
Adjusted CASM is used by Air Canada as a means to assess the operating and cost performance of its on-going airline business without the effects of aircraft fuel expense, the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations®, the operating costs of Aeroplan, and special items as such expenses may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. In calculating adjusted CASM, aircraft fuel expense is excluded from operating expense results as it fluctuates widely depending on many factors, including international market conditions, geopolitical events, jet fuel refining costs and Canada/U.S. currency exchange rates. Air Canada also incurs expenses related to ground packages at Air Canada Vacations which some airlines, without comparable tour operator businesses, may not incur. In addition, these costs do not generate ASMs and therefore excluding these costs from operating expense results provides for a more meaningful comparison across periods when such costs may vary. Excluding aircraft fuel expense, the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations and special items from operating expenses generally allows for a more meaningful analysis of Air Canada's operating expense performance and a more meaningful comparison to that of other airlines. Following the completion of Air Canada's acquisition of Aeroplan on January 10, 2019, Air Canada began consolidating Aeroplan's results. Given that the Aeroplan loyalty business was not consolidated in Air Canada's financial results in 2018, for a more meaningful comparison of the cost performance of the on-going airline business, Air Canada's adjusted CASM for 2019 excludes the operating expenses of Aeroplan. 
""Leverage ratio"" refers to net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA leverage ratio and is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to measure financial leverage. Leverage ratio is calculated by dividing net debt by trailing 12-month EBITDA (excluding special items). As mentioned above, Air Canada excludes special items from EBITDA results (which are used to determine leverage ratio) as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 
Free cash flow is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as an indicator of the financial strength and performance of its business, indicating the amount of cash Air Canada is able to generate from operations and after capital expenditures. Free cash flow is calculated as net cash flows from operating activities minus additions to property, equipment and intangible assets, and is net of proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions. Free cash flow in 2019 also excludes the one-time proceeds related to the Aeroplan acquisition. 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is used by Air Canada as a means to assess the efficiency with which it allocates its capital to generate returns. ROIC is based on adjusted pre-tax income (loss), excluding interest expense. Invested capital includes average year-over-year long-term debt, average year-over-year lease obligations, and average year-over-year shareholders' equity, net of excess cash. Air Canada defines excess cash as cash not required to operate its core business. Air Canada uses 20 per cent of trailing 12 months operating revenue as its estimate of the minimum cash required to support on-going business operations. This estimate of minimum cash provides adequate coverage for advance ticket sales and to meet Air Canada's liquidity needs. Air Canada calculates invested capital based on a book value-based method of calculating ROIC, as described above. Refer to the definition of adjusted pre-tax income (loss) for a discussion as to why Air Canada uses adjusted pre-tax income (loss) to assess the overall pre-tax financial performance of its business.

Air Canada began consolidating Aeroplan Inc.'s (""Aeroplan"") financial results on January 10, 2019, the date of its acquisition of Aeroplan.  Refer to section 9 ""Accounting Policies"" and section 10 ""Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements"" of Air Canada's Third Quarter 2019 MD&A for additional information.  


(2) 
Air Canada adopted accounting standard IFRS 16 - Leases effective January 1, 2019 with restatement of 2018 amounts.  ROIC and leverage ratio as at September 30, 2018 are not meaningful (""NM"") as trailing 12 months financial data is used in the calculation of both measures and 2017 amounts have not been restated for the adoption of IFRS 16 - Leases. 


(3) 
Adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment), EBITDA margin, free cash flow, ROIC, leverage ratio, adjusted earnings (loss) per share – diluted and adjusted CASM are each non-GAAP financial measures and net debt is an additional GAAP measure. Refer to section 16 of Air Canada's Third Quarter 2019 MD&A for descriptions of Air Canada's non-GAAP financial measures and additional GAAP measures.  


(4) 
Unrestricted liquidity refers to the sum of cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investments, and the amount of available credit under Air Canada's revolving credit facilities. At September 30, 2019, unrestricted liquidity was comprised of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5,869 million, long-term investments of $492 million and undrawn lines of credit of $994 million. At September 30, 2018, unrestricted liquidity was comprised of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4,922 million and undrawn lines of credit of $387 million. 


(5) 
Except for the reference to average number of FTE employees, operating statistics in this table include third party carriers (such as Jazz Aviation LP (""Jazz""), Sky Regional Airlines Inc. (""Sky Regional""), Air Georgian Limited (""Air Georgian"") and Exploits Valley Air Services Ltd. (""EVAS"")) operating under capacity purchase agreements with Air Canada. 


(6) 
Reflects FTE employees at Air Canada and its subsidiaries. Excludes FTE employees at third party carriers (such as Jazz, Sky Regional, Air Georgian and EVAS) operating under capacity purchase agreements with Air Canada. 


(7) 
Average stage length is calculated by dividing the total number of available seat miles by the total number of seats dispatched. 


(8) 
Revenue passengers are counted on a flight number basis (rather than by journey/itinerary or by leg) which is consistent with the IATA definition of revenue passengers carried.

ARVI in Quebec City named Canada's Best New Restaurant in 18th annual rankingTORONTO, Oct. 23, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - In a year that saw an unprecedented number of high-calibre new restaurant openings, Air Canada and presenting partner American Express are proud to reveal the Canada's Best New Restaurants Top 10 list, with Quebec City's ARVI taking the number-one spot.

Air Canada Announces Canada’s Top 10 Best New Restaurants 2019

















ARVI gives new meaning to dinner and a show. Guests can watch three chefs cook, plate and serve Michelin Star-worthy food tableside in an intimate industrial-meets-mid-century-modern setting. In second place is Vancouver's Como Taperia, a boisterous tapas restaurant run by three Spanish-cuisine aficionados. This year's third-place winner is Donna's, a Toronto neighbourhood favourite where impressively pedigreed chefs meet granny chic vibes. 

The Canada's Best New Restaurants annual list is created through a panel of leading industry experts from across the country who recommend notable restaurant openings and share insider tips. Armed with this culinary intelligence, an anonymous food critic embarks on an eating marathon, making reservations under a pseudonym. The margin for error is slim to none: restaurants got one chance to make a winning impression on her.
""Air Canada is proud to champion Canada's innovative food and drink scene for the 18th year running,"" says Andy Shibata, Managing Director, Brand, Air Canada. ""By celebrating the diverse culinary creativity on display across Canada, we are sharing unique experiences with both Canadians and an international audience while helping them to explore the country.""""Our partnership with Air Canada and Canada's Best New Restaurants is in its fifth year, and we're incredibly excited to share the list of top restaurants across the country"", said David Barnes, VP of Advertising and Communications, American Express Canada. ""Our Cardmembers rely on us to provide them with elevated access to the best experiences, especially when it comes to Canada's restaurant and culinary scene."" From restaurants creating mindful environments and positive work-life balance to a new crop of plant-forward tasting menus to nostalgic desserts, this year's best new eateries channel local, sustainable ingredients with new creativity. Here is the complete list of Air Canada's Best New Restaurants 2019:
ARVI (Quebec City): French chef Julien Masia serves up an immersive dinner-theatre experience in this Limoilou boîte. From fresh Gaspesian lobster, lovage and rhubarb to tataki-style veal rib-eye bathed in a two-year-old cheddar sauce with seared baby romaine to the five-course showstopping vegetarian tasting menu, every dish deserves a standing ovation. 
Como Taperia (Vancouver): Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside croquettes and mounds of imported Bonilla potato chips washed down with playful cocktails from the menu's G&T section are go-tos at this jumping Spain-centric watering hole. Start with rows of glistening fish from the conservas menu and stay for the soundtrack. 
Donna's (Toronto): This laid-back local favourite (think vintage teapots and houseplants) dishes out food that is anything but casual. Cue blushing slices of roast pork topped with shaved endive and tarragon and sprat-oil aioli, and the whole oven-baked sole bathed in a harissa- and chili-reddened butter sauce. 
Pluvio restaurant + rooms (Ucluelet): Glowing Douglas-fir tables made from the same tree, rock candles and rustic earthenware set the tone in this west-coast dining room. Thanks to the chef's Wickaninnish Inn pedigree, expect to see local ingredients elevated in dishes like fermented strawberries paired with miso-glazed foie gras and shortbread. 
Nowhere * a restaurant (Victoria): Mind-boggling food is coming out of Nowhere, a spot hidden inside an urban mini-mall's courtyard. The menu is all about sustainable seafood and plant-forward dishes from rockfish with morels, sea asparagus and green garlic to eggplant- and cheese-stuffed mezzaluna pasta to a swoon-worthy pork ragù. 
Dreyfus (Toronto): Two Joe Beef expats have put their stamp on Harbord Village with Canada's best new French bistro. There's the packed, handsome dining room, tightly edited selection of small-producer wines, escargot oozing with garlic, white wine and clam liquor, and dishes that pay homage to the chef's Jewish roots. 
Wayfarer Oyster House (Whitehorse): Yukon fever abounds in this casual northern dining room (picture octopus coat hooks and an oyster-shell chandelier), where seared scallops with ginger-scallion jam, enoki mushrooms and pickled chard stems are paired with a low-alcohol mint and cucumber kombucha cocktail. 
Pastel (Montreal): From the tablecloths to the walls to the chairs to the dessert, splashes of pastel are carried throughout this new, globally inspired eatery. Housemade breads arrive with a vivid fern-green-coloured cylinder of butter, and the lime-sherbet green bucatini is spiked with chlorophyll extracted from leafy greens. 
Dispatch (St. Catharines): Fizzy fermented, funky cocktails made with upcycled ingredients meet dishes made with explosively bright North African and Middle Eastern flavours in this zero-waste kitchen. In addition to the Aussie chef being environmentally conscious and community-minded, his food is also completely addictive. 
Ten (Toronto): A 10-course tasting menu for only 10 people scores a 10 out of 10 for two young Toronto-based chefs. Don't miss the seared fiddleheads, pumpkin seeds and sautéed ramps on a pillow of brioche cream, or the Ontario white beans, mushrooms and buckwheat, slow-cooked cassoulet style.

Top chefs from across the country gathered to show off their culinary skills, serving the public, industry professionals and Air Canada guests flavours from their winning menus.

MONTREAL, Oct. 16, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that it has now removed the Boeing 737 Max from its flying schedule until February 14, 2020. The decision is based on operational considerations for the airline, as it launches a new reservation system beginning next month. 
""Today we are extending to February 14, 2020 the removal of the Boeing 737 Max from our operating schedule. We are taking this prudent step as a result of the ongoing regulatory uncertainty about the timing of the aircraft returning to service. The extension will give us scheduling predictability through the implementation of the first phase of our new reservation system and the required stability as we prepare the second phase of the system roll-out, introducing it into the airport environment,"" said Lucie Guillemette, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Air Canada. ""As a result of these and other measures we are taking, including leasing two additional wide-body aircraft through at least the March Break, customers can continue to book with full confidence on Air Canada.""
In compliance with a safety notice closing Canadian airspace issued by Transport Canada on March 13, 2019, Air Canada grounded its fleet of 24 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Final decisions on returning the 737 MAX to service will be based on Air Canada's safety assessment following the lifting of government safety notices and approval by international regulatory authorities.

4ocean's First Canadian Community Shoreline Cleanup Powered by Air Canada Collect More Than 3,200 Pieces of Ocean Polluting Items









4ocean’s first Canadian community shoreline cleanup powered by Air Canada collect more than 3,200 pieces of ocean polluting items (CNW Group/Air Canada)




























""We commend the participants who came together and braved the rain to achieve these results, leaving another community ocean shoreline in better condition. Air Canada's environment commitments include reducing its use of single-use plastics and as part of a multi-pronged strategy, we have partnered with 4ocean, an organization which seeks to reduce plastic and trash pollution in oceans around the world,"" said Teresa Ehman, Senior Director, Environmental Affairs at Air Canada. 
Air Canada has made sustainability central to its decision-making and business processes and has developed detailed strategies for its environment responsibilities. With a four-pillar approach to reducing emissions through technology, operations, infrastructure and economic instruments, the airline has also designed a wide-ranging approach to reducing its use of single-use plastics. One important aspect was to identify all single-use plastics items used onboard flights to determine whether each single-use plastic item is truly necessary and whether there's a more sustainable alternative or a possible change in process that would result in using less plastic.So far, Air Canada has said #BonVoyagePlastic to 36.8 million single-use plastic items in 2019 by switching from plastic stir sticks onboard flights to sustainable wood ones, phasing out the plastic wrap from its amenity kits and removal of plastic from children's packs.Air Canada's partnership with 4ocean complements its corporate waste reduction efforts by broadening its environment responsibility to also leave less and do more in the communities where the airline operates. In 2019, 4ocean cleanup events powered by Air Canada were completed in Florida where many of its US-based employees are located, and in Richmond, British Columbia, home of the airline's primary trans-Pacific hub. Drawing from their years of experience, 4ocean will also participate with the Air Canada team to develop educational resources on ocean conservation. To date, 4ocean has removed more than six million pounds of trash from the ocean and coastlines. Among its other environment sustainability initiatives, Air Canada has also partnered in biofuel research in cooperation with the Canada Biojet Supply Chain Initiative (CBSCI) and the Civil Aviation Alternative Fuel Contrail and Emissions Research (CAAFCER). It has invested significantly with a $10 billion fleet renewal program that has given it one of the most modern, fuel efficient fleets in the world. It maintains innovative recycling, scholarship and community activity programs, that also involve employees in environmental activities. The carrier became the second North American carrier to become an official member of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Network earlier this year and is committed to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. More information about Air Canada's environment goals and programs is at: www.aircanada.com/csr and leaveless.aircanada.com.About Air Canada Air Canada is Canada's largest domestic and international airline serving nearly 220 airports on six continents.

MONTREAL, Sept. 30, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada on Saturday announced that it will establish the Captain Judy Cameron Scholarship in honour of the airline's first female pilot with the goal of helping the next generation of women follow in her trailblazing footsteps. The scholarship was announced at last night's Elsie MacGill Award Gala in Toronto, the national award program of the Northern Lights Aero Foundation which recognizes and celebrates the achievements of accomplished women in aviation and aerospace.










Retired Air Canada pilot Judy Cameron, the first female pilot at the airline, recently had a scholarship named in her honour. Hear what advice she has for women who want to follow in her footsteps.




















""We are thrilled to establish the Captain Judy Cameron Scholarship as a tribute to Judy's pioneering leadership and her tremendous professional achievements which are incredibly inspiring to all women in aviation. Air Canada has long been recognized as a company which champions equal opportunities for all qualified people. There are no glass ceilings here. Capable women with the required skills and knowledge fly high at Air Canada, working as pilots flying the most sophisticated aircraft globally, as engineers maintaining technologically advanced airplanes and systems, and in specialized, multidisciplinary airline operations. Women hold C-suite, executive and senior management roles across our airline. We are encouraging the next generation of girls and young women to pursue their aviation dreams and to consider exciting and rewarding careers in non-traditional professions, "" said Arielle Meloul-Wechsler, Senior Vice President, People, Culture and Communications at Air Canada.  


""I am incredibly honoured that Air Canada has named this scholarship after me. When I was learning to fly in 1973, my single mother had limited resources, but she believed in me and encouraged me to pursue my dream. I had a wonderful career as an Air Canada pilot. This scholarship will help other women who might be held back for financial reasons, to pursue their dreams,"" Captain Judy Cameron said. 
Judy Cameron became the first female pilot hired by Air Canada, Canada's largest airline, in April 1978 at the age of 23. She was the first woman to graduate from Selkirk College's Aviation Technology Program in 1975. Throughout her flying career of 40 years and over 23,000 hours, she has flown the DC-3, Twin Otter, Hawker Siddeley 748, DC-9, Lockheed 1011, Airbus 320, Boeing 767 and Boeing 777 to the far corners of the world. She became a captain in 1997 and in 2010, she became the first female captain in Canada of a Boeing 777, the largest aircraft in Air Canada's fleet. She retired in 2015, received the Elsie MacGill Northern Lights award in the Flight Operations category that year, and in 2016 she was chosen by the 99s (International Organization of Women Pilots) to be on its Canadian postage stamp.Air Canada has committed to awarding $20,000 per year for three years for the scholarship. The Captain Judy Cameron scholarship targets young women in pursuit of non-traditional aviation careers as commercial pilots or aircraft maintenance engineers who may not have the financial means to do so. Scholarship applications will be accepted as of November 1, 2019. It will be open to all women who are Canadian citizens who have been accepted, are enrolled or are considering a post-secondary aviation flight program or aircraft repair and maintenance program. About Air Canada Air Canada is Canada's largest domestic and international airline serving nearly 220 airports on six continents.

Air Canada Featured in Inaugural TSX30 List Recognizing Canada's Top Performing Stocks

MONTREAL, Sept. 26, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada's consistently strong share price performance has been recognized in the inaugural TSX30, a new program highlighting top performing stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange over a three-year period. The airline's inclusion underscores its successful transformation, which has resulted in a stock price appreciation of approximately 365 per cent over the past three years. Since beginning its transformation in April 2009, Air Canada's shares have appreciated by more than 5,400 per cent.
""Air Canada's inclusion in the inaugural TSX30 is a welcome recognition of the value we have created for shareholders through the ongoing transformation of our company. However, we know our financial success is rooted in providing superior service to our customers on a daily basis and for that reason this recognition also acknowledges the hard work and contributions of all Air Canada employees,"" said Michael Rousseau, Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of Air Canada.
The announcement that Air Canada is an inaugural member of the TSX30 follows on Moody's Investors Service's recent decision to upgrade Air Canada's Corporate Family Rating to Ba1 from Ba2. In issuing its upgrade, Moody's stated the higher rating ""reflects Air Canada's stronger financial profile, whereby the company has continued to reduce leverage and has strengthened its flexibility"". Earlier this year, Standard & Poor's similarly upgraded Air Canada's rating to 'BB+' from 'BB' citing lower financial risk.
""Having our greater financial resiliency acknowledged by these agencies advances us to one level below our goal of investment grade status,"" said Mr. Rousseau.

Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are based on assumptions, are subject to important risks and uncertainties and cannot be relied upon due to, amongst other things, changing external events and general uncertainties of the business. Actual results may differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including the factors identified in Air Canada's public disclosure file available at www.sedar.com and, in particular, those identified in section 14 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's second quarter 2019 MD&A and section 18 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's 2018 MD&A. Credit ratings are intended to provide investors with an independent view of credit quality. They are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.

4ocean’s first Canadian community shoreline cleanup powered by Air Canada collect more than 3,200 pieces of ocean polluting items (CNW Group/Air Canada)












""We commend the participants who came together and braved the rain to achieve these results, leaving another community ocean shoreline in better condition. Air Canada's environment commitments include reducing its use of single-use plastics and as part of a multi-pronged strategy, we have partnered with 4ocean, an organization which seeks to reduce plastic and trash pollution in oceans around the world,"" said Teresa Ehman, Senior Director, Environmental Affairs at Air Canada.  
Air Canada has made sustainability central to its decision-making and business processes and has developed detailed strategies for its environment responsibilities. With a four-pillar approach to reducing emissions through technology, operations, infrastructure and economic instruments, the airline has also designed a wide-ranging approach to reducing its use of single-use plastics. One important aspect was to identify all single-use plastics items used onboard flights to determine whether each single-use plastic item is truly necessary and whether there's a more sustainable alternative or a possible change in process that would result in using less plastic.So far, Air Canada has said #BonVoyagePlastic to 36.8 million single-use plastic items in 2019 by switching from plastic stir sticks onboard flights to sustainable wood ones, phasing out the plastic wrap from its amenity kits and removal of plastic from children's packs.Air Canada's partnership with 4ocean complements its corporate waste reduction efforts by broadening its environment responsibility to also leave less and do more in the communities where the airline operates. In 2019, 4ocean cleanup events powered by Air Canada were completed in Florida where many of its US-based employees are located, and in Richmond, British Columbia, home of the airline's primary trans-Pacific hub. Drawing from their years of experience, 4ocean will also participate with the Air Canada team to develop educational resources on ocean conservation. To date, 4ocean has removed more than six million pounds of trash from the ocean and coastlines. Among its other environment sustainability initiatives, Air Canada has also partnered in biofuel research in cooperation with the Canada Biojet Supply Chain Initiative (CBSCI) and the Civil Aviation Alternative Fuel Contrail and Emissions Research (CAAFCER).  It has invested significantly with a $10 billion fleet renewal program that has given it one of the most modern, fuel efficient fleets in the world.  It maintains innovative recycling, scholarship and community activity programs, that also involve employees in environmental activities. The carrier became the second North American carrier to become an official member of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Network earlier this year and is committed to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  More information about Air Canada's environment goals and programs is at: www.aircanada.com/csr and leaveless.aircanada.com.About Air Canada Air Canada is Canada's largest domestic and international airline serving nearly 220 airports on six continents.

VANCOUVER, Sept. 19, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Earlier this year, Air Canada announced a partnership with environmental organization 4ocean, a company dedicated to actively removing waste plastics and trash from the ocean and coastlines while inspiring individuals to work together for a cleaner ocean. Following the success of the July 2019 inaugural 4ocean cleanup event powered by Air Canada in Florida, the first Canadian Community Shoreline Cleanup event takes place Sept. 22.

Air Canada today announced the introduction of new year-round service between Montreal and Bogotá, Colombia beginning June 2, 2020 (CNW Group/Air Canada)


















""We are very pleased to offer the only non-stop, year-round flights connecting Montreal and Bogotá, two vibrant cities steeped in history and culture. This new route complements our existing Toronto-Bogotá service, and positions Air Canada as a significant player linking the growing markets between Montreal and Colombia's capital and largest city. The addition of Bogotá represents Air Canada's 39th new route launched from Montreal-Trudeau Airport since 2012, firmly illustrating our commitment to developing Montreal as an important, strategic hub. Bogotá  is also strategically situated to allow for seamless travel across South America through Star Alliance partner Avianca,"" said Mark Galardo, Vice President of Network Planning at Air Canada.
""For several years now, Aéroports de Montréal has been wanting to improve service from YUL to destinations in South America. While a flight to Sao Paolo will be inaugurated in a few weeks, Air Canada is doubling the stakes by adding this new direct connection to Bogotá, Colombia,"" said Philippe Rainville, President and CEO of Aéroports de Montréal. ""In addition to greatly facilitating air travel for members of Montreal's very large Colombian community, this announcement once again affirms YUL's role as a hub for international air traffic. We are confident that this destination will be extremely popular with travellers. And we thank our partner Air Canada who is sparing no effort to continue improving the range of destinations offered from Montreal.""""This is a very exciting announcement. We are looking forward to connecting our capital city with Montreal, the global leader in digital art and creativity, which will further advance the growth of the creative industries sector in Colombia. This new route will also enable a greater number of Canadians to experience 21st century Colombia; a vibrant country that stands out for its opportunities in innovation and entrepreneurship, and for its unparalleled offer of sustainable tourism,"" said Federico Hoyos, Colombia's Ambassador to Canada.""More excellent news for Montreal, its economic dynamism and international influence. The announcement of this year-round service between our city and Bogotá will be positive for Montrealers and we are delighted,"" said Robert Beaudry, head of economic development, trade and housing on the City of Montreal's executive committee.""This new flight consolidates Montreal's position as a hub, with openness and international accessibility. This is excellent news for developing the South American market, which has grown by more than 50% in recent years. Tourisme Montréal salutes the efforts of Air Canada. This new direct air link will undoubtedly be a tourism and economic success for Montreal, confirming its status as a gateway to Canada,"" said Yves Lalumière, President and CEO of Tourisme Montréal.

MONTREAL, Sept. 10, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced today it will upgrade its non-stop flights from Ottawa to London-Heathrow to operate the daily service with its state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Beginning next spring, customers travelling between Ottawa and London-Heathrow will have the option to fly in Air Canada's Signature cabin, featuring fully lie-flat suites, as well as the added choice of a Premium Economy cabin. 
""Air Canada is pleased to offer customers travelling between Ottawa and London-Heathrow the added comfort of service aboard our flagship Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Customers love this aircraft whose revolutionary design improves the on-board air quality, which, combined with other features such as our next generation cabin, mood lighting and other amenities, mitigates jet lag. As a result, customers arrive better rested to hit the ground running for either business or pleasure. With the Dreamliner, we are also now offering customers flying between Ottawa and London the additional option of Air Canada's Premium Economy cabin,"" said Mark Galardo, Vice President, Network Planning at Air Canada.  
The 255-seat Boeing 787-8, configured in three cabins of service, will be dedicated year-round to the route beginning March 29, 2020. It will replace a 211-seat Boeing 767-300ER with two cabins of service. 
Also today, Air Canada announced it is suspending its summer seasonal, Ottawa-Frankfurt service. The last flight on this route will be operated on October 24, 2019. Customers travelling to Europe from Ottawa next summer will have an additional option to fly to Frankfurt on a new seasonal service provided by our Star Alliance partner Lufthansa, which will begin operating on May 16th, 2020 and end October 24, 2020.

MONTREAL, Aug. 29, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced that the Superior Court of Quebec has granted a final order approving the previously announced Plan of Arrangement for the proposed combination of Air Canada and Transat A.T. Inc. There were no objections made to the court to the application, which was approved by nearly 95 per cent of shareholders at a special meeting of Transat held on Aug. 23, 2019.
The acquisition will proceed by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement pursuant to the Canada Business Corporations Act. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals and the other closing conditions set out in the Arrangement Agreement dated July 19, 2019. If such approvals are obtained and conditions are met, the transaction is expected to be completed in 2020. Further details regarding the transaction are provided in Transat's management proxy circular for the special meeting of shareholders and in the Arrangement Agreement and the Amending Agreement entered into between Air Canada and Transat, copies of which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

The only year-round flights from North America to the south west of France start June 4, 2020 
Service links two of the world's leading aerospace industry hubs
MONTREAL, Aug. 28, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced today the introduction of year-round service between Montreal and Toulouse starting June 4, 2020. The five-times weekly flights will provide the only year-round service between the two cities and be operated with Air Canada's Airbus A330-300 fleet, featuring Signature Class, Premium Economy and Economy cabins. Special introductory fares from Montreal to Toulouse start as low as $729 CDN round-trip, all-in, and tickets are now available for purchase at aircanada.com or through travel agents.

""Air Canada is very pleased to offer non-stop, year-round flights linking Montreal and Toulouse. This service will create opportunities to accelerate synergies between two of the world's leading aerospace industry hubs. Combined with our recently announced non-stop flights between Montreal and Seattle, the world's other major aerospace hub, starting next year, we are helping solidify Quebec's position as a global player in the aerospace industry, which will help maintain and encourage the growth of high-skilled, high-paying jobs in the sector. This further demonstrates the power of having a global champion in Montreal such as Air Canada; one with the capacity and network breadth to compete effectively in aviation, the most international of businesses,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer at Air Canada.


""This new route is our sixth destination in continental France and represents further growth from our Montreal hub, where Air Canada has launched 35 new global routes since 2012. Apart from its attractions as a business travel market, Toulouse is also known for its rich heritage spanning 2,000 years, abundant culture and its culinary scene. At the same time, as this route will be the only year-round service to south west France from Canada, it will strengthen Montreal's position as both a business and tourism destination while making it a premier North American Atlantic gateway, conveniently connecting customers to Air Canada's extensive North American network,"" Mr. Rovinescu concluded.
""The announcement of year-round service between Montreal and Toulouse is excellent news. Many economic sectors are bringing us closer to Toulouse, particularly aerospace, and we are convinced that this new Air Canada service will help strengthen or establish new collaborations between companies here and in Toulouse,"" said Robert Beaudry, head of economic development, housing and design on the City of Montreal's executive committee.""We are very pleased that our major partner, Air Canada, is adding this new route to Toulouse, the aeronautical capital, and enhancing air service options departing from YUL. The Montréal-Toulouse link will offer direct access year-round to one of the world's largest economic and industrial centres which is also the headquarters of Airbus, our important partner at YMX, International Aerocity of Mirabel,"" said Philippe Rainville, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aéroports de Montréal. ""This new non-stop service will strengthen the aerospace cluster in Montreal and throughout Quebec by improving access and facilitating travel for the many aerospace companies doing business in the Toulouse area, home of the headquarters for Airbus, which also has major facilities in the Montreal area. In light of a recent report that points to challenges and opportunities in the aerospace sector, this new route by Air Canada comes at an ideal time to enhance our competitiveness,"" said Suzanne Benoît, President of Aéro Montreal.Air Canada's Montreal-Toulouse flights begin June 4, 2020 and will be operated with a 292-seat, Airbus A330-300. The aircraft offers three cabins of service, including Air Canada Signature Service with fully lie-flat seats, Premium Economy and Economy service. All flights provide for Aeroplan accumulation and redemption, Star Alliance reciprocal benefits and, for eligible customers, priority check-in, Maple Leaf Lounge access at the Montreal hub, priority boarding and other benefits.

Share this article














































MONTREAL, Aug. 23, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada is pleased by the announcement, earlier today, by Transat A.T. Inc. (""Transat"") of the approval, by a majority of nearly 95% of its shareholders, of its Arrangement Agreement with Air Canada under which Air Canada will acquire all its issued and outstanding shares.
""We are pleased with the outcome of Transat's special meeting and grateful to Transat shareholders for this overwhelming show of support,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada. ""We will build a combined company greater than the sum of its parts that we can all be proud of.  We now look forward to engaging with Transport Canada and the Competition Bureau to secure the required approvals to complete the transaction and welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the many benefits it will bring."" 
""This is the best possible outcome for all stakeholders,"" added Mr. Rovinescu. ""For shareholders of Transat and Air Canada, the combination delivers excellent value, while also providing increased job security for both companies' employees through greater growth prospects. Air Canada plans to preserve the Transat and Air Transat brands and maintain the Transat head office and its key functions in Montreal. Travellers will benefit from the combined companies' enhanced capabilities in the highly competitive, global leisure travel market and from access to new destinations, more connecting traffic and increased frequencies. Customers and the Quebec economy will derive maximum advantage of having a Montreal-based, growth-oriented global champion in aviation, the world's most international business, spurring more employment and securing Montreal's position as a leader among world aviation centres.""
Plan of Arrangement
The acquisition will proceed by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement pursuant to the Canada Business Corporations Act. The transaction remains subject to court and regulatory approvals and the other closing conditions set out in the Arrangement Agreement. If such approvals are obtained and conditions are met, the transaction is expected to be completed in early 2020. Further details regarding the transaction are provided in Transat's management proxy circular for the special meeting of shareholders and in the Arrangement Agreement and the Amending Agreement entered into between Air Canada and Transat, copies of which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

To mark 35 years of loyalty, Aeroplan is launching its biggest contest yet, with the opportunity for 45 lucky members to win a total of 38.5 million miles. 










Air Canada Celebrates Aeroplan's 35th Anniversary with Biggest Contest Ever, Allowing Members to Win more than 35 Million Miles (CNW Group/Air Canada)










From August 22 to September 25, Aeroplan is offering members two ways to win. Ten lucky members will have the chance to win 3.5 million Aeroplan Miles and make their dream bucket list trip a reality. In addition, 35 members will be able to win 100,000 miles. Members can register to enter the contest by going to aeroplan.com/35 and submitting their Aeroplan number.


""We're excited to offer Aeroplan members a chance to make their dreams a reality with our biggest contest to date,"" said Mark Nasr, Vice President, Loyalty and e-Commerce at Air Canada. ""Air Canada is working hard to make immediate and tangible improvements to Aeroplan, to give members more of what they love: value, ease and flexibility. This milestone celebration is part of Air Canada's continued enhancements and improvements to the Aeroplan loyalty program as we move closer to the additional improvements coming with the relaunch of Aeroplan later next year."" 
To enter, members simply register their Aeroplan number at aeroplan.com/35 and share on social:Grand Prize Draws:There will be ten grand prize draws of 3.5 million miles. After a member registers, every transaction with an Aeroplan partner counts as an automatic entry for the grand prize. Each time you earn miles with any of Aeroplan's 75+ partners, redeem miles for a flight, hotel stay, car rental, merchandise, activities or donate miles via Aeroplan's Member Donation Program, you're entered for one of these ten grand prizes. Aeroplan affiliated cardholders get 35 bonus entries if they make at least one transaction with their card during the contest period. Share on Social:Win one of 35 secondary prizes of 100,000 miles. Share your picture-perfect trips, tag the people you would go with and hashtag #withaeroplan for a chance to win a secondary prize. Participants can post every day for more chances to win.

Air Canada to increase its purchase price from $13 to $18 per share, representing an aggregate purchase price of approximately $720 million 
Letko Brosseau, Transat's largest shareholder holding approximately 19.3% of outstanding shares, has entered into a lock-up and support agreement, confirming its support for the Air Canada acquisition

MONTREAL, Aug. 11, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada and Transat A.T. Inc. (""Transat"") announced today that Air Canada has agreed to increase the purchase price for the acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Transat, from $13 to $18 per share and have amended the Arrangement Agreement dated June 27, 2019 accordingly. Based on the increased consideration, the value of the all-cash transaction is approximately $720 million.
Air Canada has also entered into a lock-up and support agreement with Transat's largest shareholder, Letko Brosseau & Associates Inc., who beneficially owns or has control or direction over 7,277,104 Class B voting shares or approximately 19.3% of all issued and outstanding shares of Transat. Under the terms of its Lock-up and Support Agreement, Letko Brosseau has agreed to support and vote all of the Class B voting shares of Transat it controls at the Special Meeting of Shareholders of Transat on August 23, 2019 or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, in favour of Air Canada's acquisition of Transat.
Amendments to the Arrangement Agreement between Air Canada and Transat were unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of Transat and its Special Committee, and are included in an Amending Agreement that provides for the following:

an increase in the price payable by Air Canada from $13 to $18 per share, for 100% of all issued and outstanding Class A and Class B shares of Transat 
an increase in the break fee payable by Transat from $15 million to $40 million in case of termination of the agreement in certain circumstances, including upon acceptance of a Superior Proposal that is not matched by Air Canada 
a change to the definition of Superior Proposal under the Arrangement Agreement, from a third-party unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal, made at a firm price per share equal to or exceeding $14 to one that must be equal to or exceed $19 in cash

The terms and conditions of the Arrangement Agreement otherwise remain unchanged.
""After extensive consultations with Letko Brosseau and several other large shareholders of Transat, we agreed to materially increase our price to ensure the transaction receives the necessary level of support at the Special Meeting of Shareholders of Transat, said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada. We are therefore very pleased to have received Letko Brosseau's strong endorsement for our transaction. We know this achieves the best possible outcome for all stakeholders. For shareholders of Transat and Air Canada, the combination delivers excellent value, while also providing increased job security for both companies' employees through greater growth prospects. Air Canada intends to preserve the Transat and Air Transat brands and maintain the Transat head office and its key functions in Montreal. Travellers will benefit from the merged companies' enhanced capabilities in the highly competitive, global leisure travel market and from access to new destinations, more connecting traffic and increased frequencies. The Quebec economy will derive maximum advantage of having a Montreal-based, growth-oriented global champion in aviation, the world's most international business, spurring more employment and securing Montréal's position as a leader among world aviation centres"", added Mr. Rovinescu.
""We are very pleased by the added stability brought about by Air Canada's increased bid as supported by Transat's largest shareholder, Letko Brosseau. We appreciate the time and energy that Air Canada has spent in extensive consultations with our shareholders, in addition to our own efforts, with a view to ensuring the best outcome for all stakeholders. This fully funded cash transaction is the ideal platform for Transat's continued presence and growth in Montreal. We look forward to joining forces with a proven and successful player in our highly competitive and complex industry"" said Jean-Marc Eustache, President and Chief Executive Officer of Transat.
Transat has obtained fairness opinions from each of National Bank Financial and BMO Capital Markets that, as of August 11, 2019, subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications contained therein, the consideration to be received by the Transat shareholders pursuant to the Amending Agreement is fair to such shareholders from a financial point of view.
The Board of Directors of Transat and its Special Committee, supported by their financial and legal advisors, unanimously reiterate that the Arrangement with Air Canada is in the best interest of Transat and its stakeholders and is fair to Transat shareholders, and unanimously recommend that shareholders:
Vote FOR the special resolution approving the Arrangement with Air Canada
Voting Information for August 23, 2019 Meeting
For Transat shareholders who have submitted their proxies or voting instructions to Transat in favour of the Plan of Arrangement with Air Canada and do not wish to change their votes on the matters set forth therein, no further action is required and their votes will be counted at the meeting for the approval of the transaction with Air Canada in accordance with the proxies or voting instructions already submitted. For Transat shareholders who have already submitted their proxies or voting instructions and wish to change their votes, they must comply with the proxy revocation procedures set forth in the management proxy circular of Transat mailed on July 23, 2019. The cut-off time for voting and the withdrawal of proxies is 5:00 p.m. (Montréal time) on August 21, 2019.

Mach Scheme
The Board of Directors of Transat reiterates that it urges shareholders to REJECT Groupe Mach's highly abusive, coercive, misleading and conditional scheme.

For further assistance, shareholder should contact Transat's strategic shareholder advisor and proxy solicitation agent, Kingsdale Advisors, toll free in North America at 1 (888) 518-1552 or collect call outside North America at (416) 867-2272 or by e-mail at [email protected].
Plan of Arrangement

MONTREAL, Aug. 6, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that during the permitted open period following the release of its Second Quarter results, Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer, has exercised Stock Options from 2013 and sold the underlying 1,269,149 Class B Voting Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange through the facilities of a Canadian investment dealer, as reported in applicable securities filings. 
Mr. Rovinescu plans to use proceeds from the sale of shares for investment diversification, estate planning and to fund his Family Foundation for charitable giving. 
The Stock Options exercised were scheduled to expire in the first half of 2020 and the shares sold represented less than one third of Mr. Rovinescu's total equity interest in Air Canada.

Air Canada Partners with Award-Winning Canadian Chef Antonio Park to Expand Meal Options on Asian and South American Flights (CNW Group/Air Canada)










""We're thrilled to continue showcasing the very best of Canadian talent with Chef Park joining our team of celebrated Chefs. Apart from elevating our customers' dining experience with destination inspired creations on Asian and South American flights, we chose to partner with Chef Park due to his passion for promoting the Canadian culinary scene and his appreciation for fresh ingredients and sustainability,"" said Andrew Yiu, Vice President, Product at Air Canada. ""We look forward to presenting Chef Park's unique culinary creations to customers travelling to Tokyo-Narita from Montreal in our Air Canada Signature Service, Premium Economy and Economy cabins."" 


""It's a blessing and an honour to partner with Air Canada. I'm extremely proud and humbled to be sharing my food with Air Canada's customers flying at 30,000 feet beginning with the Montreal to Tokyo-Narita flight. It is the perfect opportunity to use Canadian ingredients and Japanese techniques, marrying the two to enhance the on-board experience,"" said Chef Antonio Park. ""The future of this world is education and you have to share your knowledge. This is a new chapter for the PARK restaurant family and myself. Thank you, Air Canada, for making a dream come true. Bon Appétit!""
Chef Park joins Air Canada's panel of Canadian culinary and wine talent who have designed award winning food and wine options. The panel includes:
Celebrated Canadian Chef Hawksworth, who creates signature dishes that are exclusively featured on Air Canada flights worldwide in Signature Class, and the Air Canada Signature Suite; 
Véronique Rivest, the company's sommelier, who carefully hand picks wines to pair with Chef Hawksworth's menu at 30,000 feet; 
Contemporary Chef Vikram Vij whose inspired Indian dishes are presented in all cabins of service on Air Canada's Canada-India flights from Toronto and Vancouver.
Roll-out of Chef Park's menu starts with meals on board flights between Montreal and Tokyo-Narita today followed by flights from Toronto to Tokyo-Haneda, Vancouver to Tokyo-Narita, and flights from Montreal to Sao Paulo this Fall. In 2020, Chef Park's meals will also be available on flights to Hong Kong, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei, Sao Paulo (from Toronto), Santiago and Buenos Aires, and seasonal flights from Calgary to Tokyo-Narita and Vancouver to Osaka. Chef Park's options will be available in Signature, Premium Economy and Economy Class on all flights from Canada to Japan and exclusively in Signature Class on all other flights departing Canada to Asia and South America, in addition to options created by Chef Hawksworth.This culinary partnership complements the company's investments in Air Canada Signature Service, an end-to-end premium experience that features for eligible customers a 5-star dining experience at the exclusive Air Canada Signature Suite at Toronto-Pearson International airport and best-in-class premium pre-flight and in-flight experiences across the company's network.About Chef Antonio ParkThe vision Chef Antonio Park brings to Air Canada is inspired by his culinary journey, beginning with his Korean mother's kitchen while growing up in Argentina, his training under revered Japanese cooking masters, and his decorated accomplishments as one of Canada's top celebrity Chefs. His meals will embody his experience as a Canadian who has come from afar to make this country his home while respecting the local character of the food he serves.Chef Park began cooking from a young age in his mother's kitchen in Argentina. Inspired by his mom creating everything from scratch, and working with the freshest ingredients, he developed a drive for perfection, and an appreciation for sustainability and farm-to-table cooking. This foundation carried Chef Park through his culinary journey from his first job as a dishwasher to training under Japan's most revered cooking masters.Chef Park worked in Japan, New York, Toronto, and Montreal before opening his first restaurant, Park, in Montreal in 2012. Chef Park has won many awards in Canada and has been recognized multiple times as ""Chef of the Year."" Park has been recognized by the World's 50 Best and ranked in the top 10/20 on Canada's 100 Best list in consecutive years. After establishing his first restaurants, Chef Park could be found as a judge on Food Network Canada's Chopped, and as a guest judge on Top Chef Canada. Chef Park strives to promote the Canadian culinary scene by working with Chefs across the country.

Record second quarter operating revenues of $4.757 billion 
Operating income of $422 million and EBITDA of $916 million 
Leverage ratio of 0.9 and record unrestricted liquidity of $6.907 billion

MONTREAL, July 30, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today reported second quarter 2019 EBITDA(1) (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment) of $916 million compared to second quarter 2018 EBITDA of $739 million. The airline reported second quarter 2019 operating income of $422 million compared to second quarter 2018 operating income of $308 million. Air Canada reported adjusted net income(1)  of $240 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2019 compared to adjusted net income of $129 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018. Second quarter 2019 net income amounted to $343 million or $1.26 per diluted share compared to a second quarter 2018 net loss of $102 million or $0.37 per diluted share. The second quarter of 2019 included foreign exchange gains of $117 million while the second quarter of 2018 included a loss on disposal of assets of $186 million and foreign exchange losses of $82 million.
""I am delighted to report an excellent second quarter, including record operating revenues of $4.757 billion and record liquidity of nearly $7 billion. Although our results exceeded expectations, the Boeing 737 MAX grounding negatively impacted EBITDA growth year-over-year. Our management team and all employees involved with this complex issue did an incredible job implementing creative solutions for our fleet, schedule, network and operations to get passengers to their destinations during the quarter,"" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada. 
""These are impressive results with revenue growth in each market segment and system passenger revenues up 10.7 per cent on capacity growth of 2.3 per cent. We also managed costs well, especially with the challenges of sourcing replacement flying for some of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft that are out of service. We have now exceeded our CTP cost savings goal of $250 million and reduced our leverage ratio to 0.9 from 1.2 in the previous quarter. On June 27th, we announced that we had concluded a definitive agreement to acquire Transat A.T. Inc. which, we believe, once closed, will benefit all stakeholders. Already, the merger's benefits have been recognized by key stakeholders, including Unifor, Aéroports de Montréal, Tourism Montréal, leading travel agencies, the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal, the Conseil du patronat du Québec and the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of Québec.
""The impact of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding will be felt more acutely in our very busy summer period and, as a result, third quarter EBITDA is expected to increase approximately five per cent versus the third quarter of 2018. Third quarter projected capacity is expected to decline approximately two per cent compared to the third quarter of 2018, as opposed to an originally planned capacity increase of approximately three per cent. In our planning, we will be removing the Boeing 737 MAX from our schedule until at least January 8th, 2020. This reflects our prudent approach to scheduling, giving customers certainty when booking their Fall and especially their Winter holiday travel. At present, we have no visibility on reliable timing for the return to service of the Boeing 737 MAX as we await regulatory approvals. If the aircraft are returned to service earlier, we would look for opportunities to have some enter the fleet for either replacement flying or as back-ups,"" said Mr. Rovinescu.
""Finally, I thank our customers for their loyalty, which they also showed by voting Air Canada Best Airline in North America at the 2019 Skytrax World Airline Awards. This award, which we have won for three consecutive years, speaks directly to the hard work of our employees, who also won Best Airline Staff in Canada from Skytrax. I thank our employees for their dedication to caring for our customers as they transport them safely to their destinations each day."" 
Second Quarter Income Statement Highlights
Air Canada began consolidating Aeroplan's financial results on January 10, 2019, the date of its acquisition of Aeroplan. Air Canada adopted accounting standard IFRS 16 - Leases effective January 1, 2019 and restated 2018 amounts (including for period-over-period comparisons).
On capacity growth of 2.3 per cent, record second quarter system passenger revenues of $4.338 billion increased $417 million or 10.7 per cent from the same quarter in 2018. The increase in system passenger revenues was driven by a yield improvement of 6.8 per cent and traffic growth of 3.6 per cent.  The yield improvement reflected incremental higher-yielding local traffic due to the impact of constrained capacity caused by the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and a generally improved pricing environment. The yield increase year-over-year also reflected additional yield earned by Air Canada on Aeroplan redemption revenues which Air Canada began recording subsequent to the Aeroplan acquisition on January 10, 2019.  In the second quarter of 2019, EBITDA was negatively impacted by the Boeing 737 MAX grounding, despite the positive yield effect.
In the business cabin, system passenger revenues increased $83 million or 10.2 per cent from the second quarter of 2018 on both traffic and yield growth of 5.0 per cent. 
In the second quarter of 2019, operating expenses of $4.335 billion increased $310 million or 8 per cent from the second quarter of 2018.  
Air Canada's cost per available seat mile (CASM) increased 5.2 per cent from the second quarter of 2018.  The airline's adjusted CASM(1) increased 5.9 per cent over the same quarter in 2018.  These increases reflected, in large part, the impact of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft grounding which resulted in ASM growth of less than half of what had originally been planned, higher costs associated with replacement aircraft, and on-going operating expenses, including depreciation and 
pilot wages that continued to be incurred in relation to the Boeing 737 aircraft despite their grounding. Air Canada had 24 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in its operating fleet at the time of the grounding and was expecting to receive another 12 aircraft for a total fleet of 36 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft by July 2019.  Given that the Aeroplan loyalty business was not consolidated in Air Canada's financial results in 2018, for a more meaningful comparison of the cost performance of the on-going airline business, Air Canada's adjusted CASM for the second quarter of 2019 excludes the operating expenses of Aeroplan.
Financial and Capital Management Highlights
At June 30, 2019, unrestricted liquidity (cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and undrawn lines of credit) amounted to a record $6.907 billion (June 30, 2018 – $5.064 billion).  
At June 30, 2019, net debt of $3.277 billion decreased $1.937 billion from December 31, 2018, reflecting an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investment balances of $1.467 billion and a decrease in long-term debt and lease liabilities of $470 million.  At June 30, 2019, Air Canada's leverage ratio was 0.9 versus a ratio of 1.6 at December 31, 2018.
Net cash flows from operating activities of $1.090 billion increased $9 million compared to the second quarter of 2018.  In the second quarter of 2019, free cash flow(1) of $537 million increased $413 million from the second quarter of 2018, mainly due to a lower level of capital expenditures year-over-year, in large part due to the deferral of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft deliveries. 
For the 12 months ended June 30, 2019, return on invested capital (ROIC(1)) was 15.5 per cent, significantly higher than Air Canada's weighted average cost of capital of 7.2 per cent. In the second quarter of 2019, Air Canada changed its definition of excess cash.  Air Canada defines excess cash as total cash and investments in excess of the minimum cash required to support operations.  This measure of liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term restricted cash and long-term investments.  Air Canada now uses 20 per cent of trailing 12 months operating revenue as its estimate of the minimum cash required to support on-going business operations.  This estimate of minimum cash provides adequate coverage for advance ticket sales and to meet Air Canada's liquidity needs.  Previously, Air Canada used advance ticket sales and the current portion of Aeroplan and other deferred revenue as an estimate of its cash requirements.
Normal Course Issuer Bid
In the second quarter of 2019, Air Canada purchased, for cancellation, a total of 2,770,000 shares at an average cost of $38.83 per share for aggregate consideration of $108 million (a total of 4,314,487 shares at an average cost of $36.77 per share for aggregate consideration of $159 million in the first six months of 2019). At June 30, 2019, a total of 22,645,551 shares remained available for purchase under the existing normal course issuer bid.
In the second quarter of 2018, Air Canada purchased, for cancellation, a total of 859,565 shares at an average cost of $24.92 per share for aggregate consideration of $22 million (914,218 shares at an average cost of $24.78 per share for aggregate consideration of $23 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018). 
Outlook
Because the timeline for the return to service of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft remains uncertain, for planning purposes, Air Canada is removing Boeing 737 MAX flying from its schedule until at least January 8th, 2020. Final decisions on returning the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to service will be based on Air Canada's safety assessment following the lifting of government safety notices and approval by international regulatory authorities.  Air Canada's projected capital expenditures, which can be found in section 6.6 of Air Canada's Second Quarter 2019 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results, has been updated to reflect its assumption that the remaining 12 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft deliveries scheduled for 2019 will now be delivered in 2020. 
Air Canada announced in its March 15, 2019 news release that it was suspending the financial guidance it provided on February 15, 2019 and February 28, 2019 in respect of the 2019 financial year, given the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft until further notice and Boeing's decision to suspend 737 MAX deliveries to airline customers.  
The financial guidance provided for the years 2020 and 2021 with respect to annual EBITDA margin (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment, as a percentage of operating revenue) and annual ROIC, as well as the cumulative free cash flow over the 2019-2021 period, remains in place.
Major Assumptions:  Assumptions were made by Air Canada in preparing and making forward-looking statements. As part of its assumptions, Air Canada assumes relatively modest Canadian GDP growth for the third quarter and full year 2019. Air Canada also expects that the Canadian dollar will trade, on average, at C$1.31 per U.S. dollar in the third quarter and at C$1.32 per U.S. dollar for the full year 2019 and that the price of jet fuel will average 78 CAD cents per litre in the third quarter and the full year 2019. 
Outlook provided constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws and is based on a number of assumptions (including those provided above) and subject to a number of risks.  Please see the section below entitled ""Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information"".
(1) Non-GAAP Measures
Below is a description of certain non-GAAP measures used by Air Canada in an effort to provide readers with additional information on its financial and operating performance. Such measures are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  Readers are advised to review the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Air Canada's Second Quarter 2019 MD&A for a further discussion of such non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of such measures to Canadian GAAP.

Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share – diluted are used by Air Canada as a means to assess the overall financial performance of its business without the after-tax effects of foreign exchange gains or losses, net financing expense relating to employee benefits, gains or losses on financial instruments recorded at fair value, gains or losses on sale and leaseback of assets, gains or losses on debt settlements and modifications, gains or losses on disposal of assets, and special items as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 
Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) is used by Air Canada to assess the overall pre-tax financial performance of its business without the effects of foreign exchange gains or losses, net financing expense relating to employee benefits, gains or losses on financial instruments recorded at fair value, gains or losses on sale and leaseback of assets, gains or losses on debt settlements and modifications, gains or losses on disposal of assets, and special items as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. Air Canada uses adjusted pre-tax income (loss) before interest to determine return on invested capital. 
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment) is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to view operating results before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment as these costs can vary significantly among airlines due to differences in the way airlines finance their aircraft and other assets. Air Canada excludes special items from EBITDA as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 
Adjusted CASM is used by Air Canada as a means to assess the operating and cost performance of its on-going airline business without the effects of aircraft fuel expense, the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations®, the operating costs of Aeroplan, and special items as such expenses may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 

In calculating adjusted CASM, aircraft fuel expense is excluded from operating expense results as it fluctuates widely depending on many factors, including international market conditions, geopolitical events, jet fuel refining costs and Canada/U.S. currency exchange rates.  Air Canada also incurs expenses related to ground packages at Air Canada Vacations which some airlines, without comparable tour operator businesses, may not incur.  In addition, these costs do not generate ASMs and therefore excluding these costs from operating expense results provides for a more meaningful comparison across periods when such costs may vary.  
Excluding aircraft fuel expense, the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations and special items from operating expenses generally allows for a more meaningful analysis of Air Canada's operating expense performance and a more meaningful comparison to those of other airlines. 
Following the completion of Air Canada's acquisition of Aeroplan on January 10, 2019, Air Canada began consolidating Aeroplan's results.  Given that the Aeroplan loyalty business was not consolidated in Air Canada's financial results in 2018, for a more meaningful comparison of the cost performance of the on-going airline business, Air Canada's adjusted CASM for 2019 excludes the operating expenses of Aeroplan.

""Leverage ratio"" refers to net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA leverage ratio and is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to measure financial leverage. Leverage ratio is calculated by dividing net debt by trailing 12-month EBITDA (excluding special items). As mentioned above, Air Canada excludes special items from EBITDA results (which are used to determine leverage ratio) as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful. 
Free cash flow is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as an indicator of the financial strength and performance of its business, indicating the amount of cash Air Canada is able to generate from operations and after capital expenditures. Free cash flow is calculated as net cash flows from operating activities minus additions to property, equipment and intangible assets, and is net of proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions. Free cash flow in 2019 also excludes the one-time proceeds related to the Aeroplan acquisition. 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is used by Air Canada as a means to assess the efficiency with which it allocates its capital to generate returns. ROIC is based on adjusted pre-tax income (loss), excluding interest expense. Invested capital includes average year-over-year long-term debt, average year-over-year lease obligations, and average year-over-year shareholders' equity, net of excess cash. Air Canada defines excess cash as cash not required to operate its core business. Air Canada uses 20 per cent of trailing 12 months operating revenue as its estimate of the minimum cash required to support on-going business operations. This estimate of minimum cash provides adequate coverage for advance ticket sales and to meet Air Canada's liquidity needs. Air Canada calculates invested capital based on a book value-based method of calculating ROIC, as described above. Refer to the definition of adjusted pre-tax income (loss) for a discussion as to why Air Canada uses adjusted pre-tax income (loss) to assess the overall pre-tax financial performance of its business.

Air Canada's Second Quarter 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and its Second Quarter 2019 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition are available on Air Canada's website at aircanada.com and will be filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

(1) 
Air Canada began consolidating Aeroplan Inc.'s (""Aeroplan"") financial results on January 10, 2019, the date of its acquisition of Aeroplan.  Refer to section 9 ""Accounting Policies"" and section 10 ""Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements"" of Air Canada's Second Quarter 2019 MD&A for additional information.  


(2) 
Air Canada adopted accounting standard IFRS 16 - Leases effective January 1, 2019 with restatement of 2018 amounts.  ROIC and leverage ratio as at June 30, 2018 are not meaningful as trailing 12 months financial data is used in the calculation of both measures and 2017 amounts have not been restated for the adoption of IFRS 16 - Leases. 


(3) 
Adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment), EBITDA margin, free cash flow, ROIC, leverage ratio, adjusted earnings (loss) per share – diluted and adjusted CASM are each non-GAAP financial measures and net debt is an additional GAAP measure. Refer to section 16 of Air Canada's Second Quarter 2019 MD&A for descriptions of Air Canada's non-GAAP financial measures and additional GAAP measures.  


(4) 
Unrestricted liquidity refers to the sum of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the amount of available credit under Air Canada's revolving credit facilities. At June 30, 2019, unrestricted liquidity was comprised of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5,921 million and undrawn lines of credit of $986 million. At June 30, 2018, unrestricted liquidity was comprised of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4,670 million and undrawn lines of credit of $394 million. 


(5) 
Except for the reference to average number of FTE employees, operating statistics in this table include third party carriers (such as Jazz Aviation LP (""Jazz""), Sky Regional Airlines Inc. (""Sky Regional""), Air Georgian Limited (""Air Georgian"") and Exploits Valley Air Services Ltd. (""EVAS"")) operating under capacity purchase agreements with Air Canada. 


(6) 
Reflects FTE employees at Air Canada and its subsidiaries. Excludes FTE employees at third party carriers (such as Jazz, Sky Regional, Air Georgian and EVAS) operating under capacity purchase agreements with Air Canada. 


(7) 
Average stage length is calculated by dividing the total number of available seat miles by the total number of seats dispatched. 


(8) 
Revenue passengers are counted on a flight number basis (rather than by journey/itinerary or by leg) which is consistent with the IATA definition of revenue passengers carried.

Improvements to Aeroplan are part of Air Canada's promise to build the most rewarding program in the country, launching in 2020

MONTREAL, July 17, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has revealed changes to Aeroplan that mark the beginning of many improvements being planned as it moves toward launching its new loyalty program in summer 2020.   Designed to make Aeroplan more flexible and member-friendly, the changes to its flight rewards include: full refunds within 24 hours of booking, the option to refund your flight reward up to two hours before departure, a reduction of the aeroplan.com refund fee and complimentary changes and refunds for Air Canada Altitude Super Elite 100K members.  
""Choice and flexibility are at the core of our loyalty plans, so we're excited to introduce the first of many changes for Aeroplan Members as we work to create the best travel loyalty program,"" said Mark Nasr, Vice President, Loyalty and eCommerce, Air Canada.  ""As Aeroplan celebrates its 35th anniversary this month it provides a strong foundation for our new program. The changes we are announcing today will provide members with more flexibility and peace of mind while still delivering the same unbeatable value so they can reach their travel goals.""  
In order to provide greater ease and flexibility, Aeroplan Members' new options include:

Complimentary, full refunds within 24 hours of booking: Aeroplan Members will be able to cancel and refund Flight Rewards for free within 24 hours of booking. 
Option to refund your Flight Reward up to two hours before departure: Previously, Aeroplan Flight Reward bookings could not be refunded within 21 days of departure. With these changes, Aeroplan Members will be able to cancel and refund their Flight Reward booking for a fee up until two hours prior to the departure time of the first flight in the reservation. This will apply to all bookings, including those made prior to the new policy coming into effect. Rather than keeping cancelled tickets open for future travel, Aeroplan Miles, taxes and fees will be refunded, and members may book new tickets anytime in the future, delivering greater convenience than before. 
Reduction of the aeroplan.com Refund Fee: Aeroplan will lower the Refund Fee from $150 to $125 for refunds completed via aeroplan.com. The new, lower fee will apply to all bookings, including those made prior to the new policy coming into effect. Aeroplan diamond status members will continue to enjoy lower fee amounts, and Air Canada Altitude Super Elite 100K members will not be charged the fee. 
New for Air Canada Altitude Super Elite 100K members, complimentary changes and refunds: Air Canada Altitude Super Elite 100K members will now receive complimentary changes to their Flight Reward bookings and refunds when they request a change or refund to their Flight Reward booking. These fee waivers will apply to all bookings, including those made prior to the new policy coming into effect.

Canada's largest airline reunites family and friends in new holiday campaign
MONTREAL, Nov. 28, 2017 /CNW Telbec/ - In keeping with the holiday spirit, Air Canada is announcing a new campaign, starting with a social media contest where Canadians can win a pair of roundtrip flights on any Air Canada route and bring loved ones home for the holidays.
"We've all had that moment at the arrival gate when we scan the crowd for that special person. Whether you've been in the air for one hour or fifteen hours, the second you lock eyes with your loved one, you know you're home," says Andy Shibata, Managing Director, Brand at Air Canada. "We want to celebrate these universal moments of love this holiday season by creating a few more."
To kick things off, Air Canada asked members of its social media communities to share a story of someone they want to bring home for the holidays. Eight of the best entries, from the most fun to the most meaningful, will win a pair of roundtrip tickets to bring that person and a guest home from anywhere in the world Air Canada flies. Next up to add even more holiday spirit, Air Canada will celebrate reunions at select airports across the country, followed by the launch of a national video campaign that captures the meaning of home during the season.   
"No airline flies to as many Canadian destinations from as many parts of the world as we do," says Mr. Shibata.  "Our customers rely on us to bring them home to their families and friends. During the holiday season we are honoured to play this special role in their lives."

Entries are accepted on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram from November 24th until December 1st. Eight pairs of tickets—one set per day of the contest period—will be awarded. Rules and regulations can be found at aircanada.com/HomefortheHolidays.

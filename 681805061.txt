MONTREAL, May 4, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada advises customers that a significant wind and thunder storm at Toronto-Pearson has affected airport operations, a number of flights across the airline's system have been cancelled or diverted. Customers should check the status of their flights at www.aircanada.com before going to airports throughout the network.
We are working diligently to restore normal operations, but due to airport facility constraints and air traffic control restrictions it will not be possible to operate our normal schedule for the rest of the day. Wind gusts have reached 119 kilometers per hour causing damage to air bridges, air field equipment and aircraft due to blowing ramp equipment at Toronto-Pearson. We thank our customers for their patience and understanding.
Air Canada has put in place a flexible rebooking policy for customers who wish to change their travel to or from Toronto. We are also planning to add capacity as soon as possible to move customers affected by these events.
Customers may contact Air Canada Reservations (1-888-247-2262) to change their flight, free of charge, to another date subject to availability in the cabin you originally purchased. Otherwise, any fare difference will apply.

Strategically increases international flights at YVR hub following announcement of the only non-stop flights to Brisbane, Australia 
VANCOUVER, Oct. 30, 2015 /CNW/ - Air Canada today announced it is boosting international flights at its Vancouver hub next summer with double daily flights from YVR to London Heathrow. In addition, the airline's new non-stop flights from Vancouver to Brisbane, Australia will now launch two weeks earlier on June 1 to meet demand. 
"Air Canada is strategically increasing its international flights at YVR with a second daily flight to London Heathrow next summer in response to seasonal travel demand," said Benjamin Smith, Air Canada President, Passenger Airlines. "Our second London flight beginning June 1 will be operated with new state-of-the-art Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft, and in fact, both London flights will feature our newly designed International Business Class product, and offer customers a choice of three cabins of service and industry-leading amenities. 
"We are the only airline to fly double daily to London next summer from YVR.  With this along with our new non-stop, year-round flights to Brisbane, Australia now beginning on June 1, plus increased capacity on flights from YVR to Sydney, Australia with Boeing 777 aircraft that will be newly converted, featuring our new international product standard offering a choice of three cabins of service, Air Canada is reinforcing YVR as an important hub, connecting our B.C., Western Canada and U.S. routes with our South Pacific, Asian and European network," concluded Mr. Smith.

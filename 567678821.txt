MONTREAL, Feb. 4, 2016 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has been recognized for the third year in a row as one of "Montreal's Top Employers" in an annual employer survey by Mediacorp Canada Inc. The 2016 survey recognizes employers with exceptional human resources programs and forward-thinking workplace policies after editors conducted a detailed review of company operations and Human Resources practices, including a comparison of others in their industry and region.
"Headquartered in Montréal and with over 5,500 employees in the area, Air Canada is thrilled to once again be named among the top employers in Montreal and recognized for its training programs and its charitable efforts through the Air Canada Foundation among several other criteria. As we continue on our quest to become a global champion in our industry and building our Montreal hub, it is important for us to be employee-focused to retain and attract Canada's best and brightest, and this recognition affirms that we are," said Arielle Meloul-Wechsler, Vice President Human Resources at Air Canada. "Air Canada has long been regarded as a progressive employer and on average we receive more than 290 applications for each job we fill." 
Employers in the "Montreal's Top Employers" survey are evaluated by the editors of Canada's Top 100 Employers using the same eight criteria as the national competition: (1) Physical Workplace; (2) Work Atmosphere &amp; Social; (3) Health, Financial &amp; Family Benefits; (4) Vacation &amp; Time Off; (5) Employee Communications; (6) Performance Management; (7) Training &amp; Skills Development; and (8) Community Involvement. Employers are compared to other organizations in their field to determine which offer the most progressive and forward-thinking programs.

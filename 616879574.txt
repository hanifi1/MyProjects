MONTRÉAL, March 22, 2017 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today said it welcomes funding in the Federal Budget that will improve airport security screening processes at Canadian airports. This will benefit travellers by reducing wait times and should enhance the overall travel experience.
Air Canada is committed to working with the federal government on further actions to improve all aspects of passenger facilitation to position Canada to capture a larger share of international passenger flows. Such measures would strengthen Air Canada hubs, supporting additional destination, routing and frequency choices for our customers. Beyond this, Air Canada encourages the government to undertake further efforts to ensure Canada's air transport infrastructure is cost competitive with other jurisdictions in terms of taxes, fees and other levies placed on travellers and carriers.

 MONTREAL, Feb. 8, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today launched a worldwide seat sale to kick-off a yearlong celebration of the airline's 75th anniversary and introduced a new, all-inclusive pricing approach to advertising that makes it easier for customers to shop, compare and determine the final cost of air travel. 
 "This is a seat sale that has been 75 years in the making and Air Canada is pleased to offer customers a chance to celebrate our milestone birthday by putting the world on sale until February 16. With these special fares, Air Canada is introducing a new, all-in approach to advertising fares that will prominently display a final price accompanied by a breakdown of the base fare plus the total cost of additional charges, such as taxes, fees and surcharges. Our all-in price advertising initiative is a response to our customers' increased desire for transparency and simplicity when shopping for air fares, whether they do so through print advertising, online searches or by signing up for our webSaver email specials," said Craig Landry, Vice President of Marketing at Air Canada.

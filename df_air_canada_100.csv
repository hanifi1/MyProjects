Air Canada Proposes Science-Based Approach to Easing Quarantine Act Restrictions

Proposed measures endorsed by medical professionals globally and the International Air Transport Association 
Mirror those adopted by the European Union, the United Kingdom and other worldwide jurisdictions 

MONTREAL, July 15, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada's Chief Medical Officer today issued a letter urging the Canadian government to consider a science-based approach to easing the Quarantine Act restrictions, which have been essentially unchanged since March, to strike a better balance for travellers and for the Canadian economy without adversely impacting public health. 
Air Canada is not proposing relaxing the U.S. border restrictions at this time - only to replace the quarantine requirements for those countries with a low COVID-19 risk from a public health perspective with more proportionate, evidence-based measures and experiences from other countries.
Air Canada notes that other G20 countries have implemented practical, evidence-based approaches to travel by minimizing the risk of COVID-19 exposure through a range of measures endorsed by medical professionals worldwide including:

Determination of safe corridors or travel between approved jurisdictions with fewer cases on the basis of low risk from a public health perspective (an approach adopted in the UK, France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal among others) 
Requirement for a pre-departure, medically certified negative COVID-19 test in order to enter the country (Caribbean islands) 
Waiver of quarantine requirements following a negative test on arrival (Iceland, Austria, Luxembourg) 
Mandatory testing on arrival (South Korea, Hong Kong, Macao, United Arab Emirates)

A full copy of Air Canada's letter signed by its Chief Medical Officer and providing a robust science-based approach for easing the 14-day quarantine is here.
Air Canada has been at the forefront of the airline industry in responding to COVID-19, including being among the first carriers globally to require customer face coverings onboard and the first airline in the Americas to take customers' temperatures prior to boarding. In May it introduced a comprehensive program, Air Canada CleanCare+, to apply industry leading biosafety measures at each stage of the journey.
Air Canada has recently undertaken several medical collaborations to further advance biosafety across its business, including with Cleveland Clinic Canada for medical advisory services, Ottawa-based Spartan Bioscience to explore portable COVID-19 testing technology and, since 2019, with Toronto-based BlueDot for real-time infectious disease global monitoring.
About Air Canada Air Canada is Canada's largest domestic and international airline. Canada's flag carrier is among the 20 largest airlines in the world and in 2019 served over 51 million customers. Air Canada is a founding member of Star Alliance, the world's most comprehensive air transportation network. Air Canada is the only international network carrier in North America to receive a Four-Star ranking according to independent U.K. research firm Skytrax, which also named Air Canada the 2019 Best Airline in North America.

Global healthcare leader to provide medical advisory services as airline further develops biosafety measures validated with science-based evidence 
MONTREAL, July 9, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced today that Cleveland Clinic, a global healthcare leader, will provide medical advisory services as the airline further develops biosafety measures across its operations. Air Canada will have access to the local expertise of Cleveland Clinic Canada as well as clinical expertise from Cleveland Clinic's worldwide enterprise system. 
""As airline travel adapts to a new normal, we are taking another leadership role via our partnership with renowned Cleveland Clinic which enables Air Canada to leverage the strategic insight, advice, resources and recommendations of the world's leading medical community to further develop protocols, guidelines and standards validated with science-based evidence in our ongoing COVID-19 response. We are committed in our ongoing strategy of continually developing multiple layers of measures for our customers and employees alike,"" said Samuel Elfassy, Vice President, Safety at Air Canada. 
Air Canada has been at the forefront of the airline industry in responding to COVID-19, including being among the first carriers globally to require face coverings onboard and the first airline in the Americas to take customers' temperatures prior to boarding. In May it introduced a comprehensive program, Air Canada CleanCare+, to apply industry leading biosafety measures at each stage of the journey.
The Clinic's Medical Director Program was initiated in Canada for domestic and global companies and is supported by management and clinical experts across the enterprise to provide strategic guidance on health and safety matters for customer safety.  As the Medical Advisor to Air Canada, Cleveland Clinic will provide access to leading expertise including guidance on:

Infectious exposure and toxicology 
Pandemic and infrastructure response planning and prevention 
Medical contingency plans and process development 
Crisis and organizational risk management

""As the public begins to adjust to a world that's been altered by the COVID-19 pandemic, health and safety is of the utmost importance,"" said Michael Kessel, Cleveland Clinic Canada, CEO and President. ""It is an honour to use our 99 years of clinical expertise to support Canadian organizations in a way that helps protect our communities.""

Portable kits that quickly detect COVID-19 further support the airline's multi-layered biosafety approach 
MONTREAL, July 8, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada is pleased to announce it has engaged Spartan Bioscience Inc., an Ottawa-based biotechnology leader in portable DNA testing technology, to assess how best to deploy Spartan's portable COVID-19 testing technology in the aviation sector. 
""Air Canada's strategy for managing COVID-19 has been to develop and apply multiple layers of biosafety measures for customers and employees. We believe the availability of a rapid, accurate, portable molecular test for COVID-19 will add yet another effective layer. We are excited by the potential and point of care use cases for the Spartan Cube, and look forward to working with the Spartan team in the weeks and months ahead,"" said Samuel Elfassy, Vice President, Safety at Air Canada. 
Air Canada has been at the forefront of the airline industry in responding to COVID-19, for example being among the first carriers globally to require face coverings onboard and the first airline in the Americas to take customers' temperatures prior to boarding. In May it introduced a comprehensive program, Air Canada CleanCare+, to apply biosafety measures at each stage of the journey. Air Canada has committed to adding other processes and technologies as they become available, which is why it is pleased to be working with Spartan Bioscience.
Spartan is developing a proprietary swab for the collection of DNA samples for its COVID-19 test. Spartan's test cartridge (reagents) and the Spartan Cube (portable DNA analyzer device) remain subject to Health Canada approval.
""Spartan is excited to explore how our fast, portable testing technology can help keep Air Canada employees and the travelling public safe as Canada's economy re-opens,"" said Nick Noreau, Spartan Bioscience's Chief Revenue Officer.
For more information on Air Canada CleanCare+ please see www.aircanada.com

Air Canada Discontinues Service on 30 Domestic Regional Routes and Closes Eight Stations in Canada

Air Canada

Regional flying rationalized due to COVID-19 and government travel restrictions, part of airline's Cost Reduction Program to reduce cash burn
MONTREAL, June 30, 2020  /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that it is indefinitely suspending service on 30 domestic regional routes and closing eight stations at regional airports in Canada.  
These structural changes to Air Canada's domestic regional network are being made as a result of continuing weak demand for both business and leisure travel due to COVID-19 and provincial and federal government-imposed travel restrictions and border closures, which are diminishing prospects for a near-to-mid-term recovery. 
As the company has previously reported, Air Canada expects the industry's recovery will take a minimum of three years. As a consequence, other changes to its network and schedule, as well as further service suspensions, will be considered over the coming weeks as the airline takes steps to decisively reduce its overall cost structure and cash burn rate.
A full list of route suspensions and station closures is below.
As a result of COVID-19, Air Canada reported a net loss of $1.05 billion in the first quarter of 2020, including a net cash-burn in March of $688 million. The carrier has undertaken a range of structural changes including significant cost savings and liquidity measures, of which today's announced service suspensions form part. Other measures include:

A workforce reduction of approximately 20,000 employees, representing more than 50 per cent of its staff, achieved through layoffs, severances, early retirements and special leaves; 
A company-wide Cost Reduction and Capital Deferral Program, that has to date identified around $1.1 billion in savings; 
A reduction of its system-wide capacity by approximately 85 per cent in the second quarter compared to last year's second quarter and an expected third quarter capacity reduction of at least 75% from the third quarter of 2019; 
The permanent removal of 79 aircraft from its mainline and Rouge fleets; 
And raising approximatively $5.5 billion in liquidity since March 13, 2020, through a series of debt, aircraft and equity financings.

Further initiatives are being considered.
Route Suspensions 
The following routes will be suspended indefinitely as per applicable regulatory notice requirements. Affected customers will be contacted by Air Canada and offered options, including alternative routings where available.

Flexible rebooking options for Economy Class customers booked on flights near capacity 
Touchless airport services including TouchFree Bag Check and virtual queuing at select counters 
Meals designed by Air Canada culinary panel to resume

Attention editors: Videos explaining measures that are part of the multi-layered Air Canada CleanCare+ bio-safety program are available online here.
MONTREAL, June 29, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced it is advancing its industry-leading bio-safety measures by offering flexible rebooking options to Economy Class customers on flights that are close to capacity, introducing additional touchless processes at airports, and enhancing inflight service and amenities.
""As we rebuild our schedule, we are continually increasing the range of products and services available to safely and efficiently enhance our customers' travel experience. As of July 1, we will be transparent about flights booked close to capacity in Economy Class and will provide rebooking options for customers booked on such flights.  In addition, we are introducing industry-leading, streamlined, touchless airport processes such as TouchFree Bag Check and virtual queuing, and will be resuming meals designed by our Canadian chef culinary panel. We continue to assess new bio-safety initiatives to further build on the multi-layered, bio-safety approach our best-in-class Air Canada CleanCare+ Program features to give customers confidence in a safe, secure, and enhanced travel experience with Air Canada,"" said Andrew Yiu, Vice-President - Product at Air Canada. 
Options for customers when Economy Class is booked close to capacity
Starting July 1, Air Canada will replace its policy of guaranteeing adjacent seats in Economy Class are empty with a new transparent process offering flexible rebooking options for customers. On flights where Economy Class is booked close to capacity, notification emails will be sent to Economy Class customers in advance of check-in and announcements will be made at the departure gate. Customers will have the option to change to another flight operating within three days or to the next available flight without additional fees. 
Airports: Touchless services 
Air Canada has implemented TouchFree Bag Check, an industry-leading process for all domestic flights from Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary airports, and is now expanding this process to other select Canadian airports, as well as for customers departing on international flights. Watch a demonstration here.  
Later in July, virtual queuing will also be introduced at primary Canadian airports to more efficiently manage wait times at select counters. Customers requiring service from an airport agent can simply scan their boarding card to enter a virtual queue and they will be notified via their smartphone to proceed to the counter for assistance.
Maple Leaf Lounges are expected to begin re-opening later this summer.
Air Canada is continuing to evaluate and assess additional touchless and new bio-safety initiatives in airports to further advance efficient, safe and secure travel.
On-board: Meals developed by Canadian panel of culinary talent to resume 
Beginning late July, Air Canada will resume meal service planned by its panel of celebrated Canadian chefs in Air Canada Signature Class, and for the first time, will introduce chef-designed meals in Business Class – North America. Customers travelling on international flights in Economy Class will enjoy an enhanced meal service.
Limited inflight food options in Economy Class onboard North American flights greater than two hours will be re-introduced on a pre-order basis.  
Customers will also be offered an expanded selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks adapted by cabin and route.
In addition to Air Canada CleanCare+ customer care kits containing hand sanitizer, a mask, antibacterial wipes, hand sanitizer, gloves, water bottle, headphones and a snack, additional antibacterial wipes will be available as part of each meal service and in lavatories.  Pillows and blankets will be offered again on all international flights and presented to customers wrapped and sealed.
Air Canada's summer schedule includes nearly 100 destinations across Canada, the US and worldwide. Learn more about Air Canada's CleanCare+ biosafety program that embed industry-leading safe practices in all stages of the airline's operations.

Air Canada Completes Financing Transactions Raising Additional $1.23 Billion

$840 million Second Lien Secured Notes financing with proceeds of $823 million 
US$315 million Class C Pass Through Certificates, Series 2020-1 with proceeds of US$300 million ($405 million) 
A total of $5.5 billion of liquidity raised since March 13, 2020

MONTREAL, June 22, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced that it recently closed two additional financing transactions for net proceeds of $1.23 billion. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, Air Canada has raised $5.5 billion of liquidity.  
On June 22, 2020, Air Canada completed a private offering of $840 million aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Second Lien Secured Notes due 2024 (the ""2024 Notes""), which were sold at 98% of par. The 2024 Notes are secured obligations of Air Canada, secured on a second lien basis by certain real estate interests, ground service equipment, certain airport slots and gate leaseholds, and certain routes and the airport slots and gate leaseholds utilized in connection with those routes.
Earlier in June, Air Canada completed a private offering of one tranche of Class C EETCs with a combined aggregate face amount of approximately US$315 million, which were sold at 95.002% of par. The Class C tranche ranks junior to the previously issued Series 2015-1, Series 2015-2, and Series 2017-1 EETCs, and is secured by liens on the 27 aircraft financed under the Series 2015-1, Series 2015-2, and Series 2017-1 EETCs. The Class C EETCs have an interest rate of 10.500% per annum, and a final expected distribution date of July 15, 2026. 
""The fact Air Canada was able to add $1.23 billion to its liquidity with these last two transactions without utilizing any of its previously disclosed unencumbered assets leaves the airline in an excellent position to access additional funds should the need arise. Complementing these efforts have been ongoing initiatives to reduce cash burn through such measures as workforce reductions, a $1.1 billion Cost Transformation Program and capacity and network rationalization,"" said Pierre Houle, Managing Director and Treasurer of Air Canada.
In addition to these more recent financings, Air Canada also concluded the following financing transactions in 2020:

In March 2020, Air Canada drew down its US$600 million and $200 million revolving credit facilities for aggregate proceeds of $1.03 billion. 
In April 2020, Air Canada concluded a 364-day term loan in the amount of US$600 million, secured by aircraft and spare engines, for proceeds of $829 million. 
In late April 2020, Air Canada concluded a bridge financing of $788 million for 18 Airbus A220 aircraft which Air Canada expects to replace with longer-term secured financing arrangements later in 2020. 
In June 2020, Air Canada concluded an underwritten marketed public offering of 35,420,000 Class A Variable Voting Shares and/or Class B Voting Shares of the Company at a price to the public of $16.25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $575.6 million, and a concurrent marketed private placement of convertible senior unsecured notes due 2025 for aggregate proceeds of US$747.5 million ($1.01 billion).

""We entered 2020 on the doorstep of investment grade with a very strong balance sheet, low net leverage and significant liquidity, before the COVID-19 pandemic and government-imposed quarantines and border restrictions destroyed demand and depleted cash. Air Canada's strong relative position has allowed us to navigate through this crisis and we have full confidence that we will be successful in maintaining liquidity at levels more than sufficient to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities ahead. With these latest transactions Air Canada has now raised approximately $5.5 billion in 2020 and expects to end the second quarter of 2020 with at least $9 billion in liquidity,"" concluded Mr. Houle. 
Air Canada is utilizing the net proceeds from these transactions to supplement its working capital and for other general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the financings will serve to increase Air Canada's cash position, thereby allowing for additional flexibility both from an operational standpoint and in the implementation of its planned mitigation and recovery measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Air Canada's unencumbered asset pool (excluding the value of Aeroplan and Air Canada Vacations) amounts to approximately $2.5 billion at current exchange rates. Air Canada will continue to explore financing arrangements should additional liquidity be required or to refinance existing debt to push out maturities.
CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONThis news release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Such forward-looking statements may be based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements may involve, but are not limited to, comments relating to guidance, strategies, expectations, planned operations or future actions, and the Company's expectations with respect to the use of proceeds from the Offerings. Forward-looking statements are identified using terms and phrases such as ""preliminary"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""could"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""intend"", ""may"", ""plan"", ""predict"", ""project"", ""will"", ""would"", and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are based on assumptions, including those described herein and are subject to important risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements cannot be relied upon due to, amongst other things, changing external events and general uncertainties of the business. Actual results may differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed below. The value of assets in Air Canada's unencumbered asset pool may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, including market and economic conditions and currency exchange rates.
Air Canada, along with the rest of the global airline industry, is facing a severe and abrupt drop in traffic and a corresponding decline in revenue as a result of the coronavirus (""COVID-19"") pandemic and the travel restrictions imposed in many countries around the world, including Canada and the United States.  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began to be felt in traffic and sales figures commencing in early March 2020. These impacts include drastic declines in earnings and cash from operations. There is very limited visibility on travel demand given government restrictions in place; these restrictions and concerns about travel due to the COVID-19 virus and passenger expectations about the need for certain precautions, such as physical distancing, are severely inhibiting demand. Air Canada cannot predict the full impact or the timing for when conditions improve, but believes that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will last at least three years. Air Canada is actively monitoring the situation and will respond as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, which will depend on a number of factors including the course of the virus, government actions, and passenger reaction, none of which can be predicted with any degree of certainty.
Other factors that may cause results to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements include those factors identified in Air Canada's public disclosure file available at www.sedar.com and, in particular, those identified in section 14 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's First Quarter 2020 MD&A and section 20 ""Risk Factors"" of Air Canada's 2019 MD&A. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release represent Air Canada's expectations as of the date of this news release (or as of the date they are otherwise stated to be made) and are subject to change after such date. However, Air Canada disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under applicable securities regulations.

Proxy Advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis recommend endorsing all motions
MONTREAL, June 15, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that due to social distancing requirements arising from COVID-19, it will hold its 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders virtually, online, on Thursday, June 25, 2020. The event begins at 10:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) and will be accessible only via live webcast available at https://aircanada.com/AGM.
Shareholders will be able to vote on motions, of which there are currently four before the meeting, including: the election of directors who will serve until the end of the next annual shareholder meeting; the appointment of auditors; consideration and approval, in an advisory, non-binding capacity, of Air Canada's approach to executive compensation; and a motion to renew the existing shareholder rights plan. Full details are contained in the management proxy circular, a copy of which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the company's website.
Air Canada is pleased to announce that both Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass Lewis & Co., LLC, two leading independent proxy advisory firms, have recommended that shareholders of Air Canada endorse all motions.
Shareholders will not be able to physically attend the meeting but will have an equal opportunity to participate online regardless of their geographic location. As with prior years, shareholders are able to vote ahead of the meeting by proxy using the various available channels and are encouraged to continue to vote in this manner. 
Registered shareholders and duly appointed proxyholders will be able to participate, submit questions and vote at the meeting online, provided they follow the registration instructions set out in the management proxy circular. Shareholders may otherwise attend the meeting as guests, but guests will not be able to vote or ask questions at the meeting.

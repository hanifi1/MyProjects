MONTREAL, May 12, 2017 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced today that its leisure airline, Air Canada Rouge, has begun offering high-speed, satellite internet aboard its Airbus A319 aircraft. Air Canada Rouge customers will now have access to the fastest internet service on a Canadian airline, giving them the ability to email, stream video and music, surf the web and more while flying.

"Air Canada is proud to be ranked once more among the Top 100 Employers in Canada. That we have now received this recognition for four years running validates our success with one of our most important corporate priorities, culture change within our organization to make it more entrepreneurial with a heightened customer focus. Our reputation as one of the best places to work in Canada also enables us to attract and retain the best available talent, securing our place as a leading global carrier," said Arielle Meloul-Wechsler, Vice President Human Resources at Air Canada.

ST. JOHN'S, Feb. 29, 2016 /CNW/ - Air Canada today announced it will increase capacity on two of its routes serving Labrador &amp; Newfoundland by 48 per cent for summer 2016 travel. Effective May 1, 2016, flights between Happy Valley-Goose Bay and Halifax, and Happy Valley-Goose Bay and St. John's will be operated by Air Canada Express with 74-seat Bombardier Q400 aircraft instead of the current Bombardier 50-seat CRJ.
"We are pleased to offer our customers in Labrador more capacity to Halifax and St. John's to meet increased travel demand this summer," said Benjamin Smith, President Passenger Airlines Air Canada. "By strategically deploying our fleet to meet seasonal shifts in demand, the additional seats and cargo capacity will benefit both business travel in the hydroelectric sector and the tourism industry."

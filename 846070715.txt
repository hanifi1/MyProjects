"We wanted to create an ad that reflected the magic and celebration that takes place during this time of year," said Andrew Shibata, Managing Director, Brand at Air Canada. "With our travelers reuniting and gathering all over the world, all 36,000 Air Canada employees feel very fortunate to play a part of their journeys home for the holidays."

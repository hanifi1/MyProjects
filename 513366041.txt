 MONTREAL, Dec. 4, 2013 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada is premiering its brand new international cabin design and seating that the airline will feature on its Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet. Visit 787.aircanada.com for full details and a virtual tour of the aircraft and new cabin amenities. The airline will take delivery of the first of 37 Boeing 787 aircraft in the spring of 2014. 
 "We are very excited to introduce completely re-designed seating and cabin amenities that will offer Air Canada customers the very best in comfort and contemporary design," said Ben Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. "With the arrival next spring of our first Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Air Canada continues to renew its international widebody fleet with the next generation of modern and fuel efficient aircraft. As North America's Best Airline, we look forward to taking delivery of our first 787 Dreamliner and continuing to raise the bar in customer comfort." 
 Air Canada will provide three cabins of service on board its Boeing 787 Dreamliners highlighted by a brand new contemporary decor and comfortable ergonomic seating that features 180-degree lie-flat seats in its International Business Class cabin. An extensive choice of in-flight entertainment on enhanced definition seat back touch screens will be available for all customers along with power outlets and USB ports. 
 Beginning in July 2014, the first Air Canada route to be operated with 787 Dreamliner aircraft featuring the new cabin interior and amenities will be the carrier's Toronto-Tel Aviv route. Seats are now available for booking. 
 As the first three 787 aircraft are gradually introduced into the Air Canada fleet in the spring of 2014, the airline will offer a preview of its new Dreamliner service on select domestic Canada and transatlantic flights on a temporary basis. 
 "The introduction of Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 aircraft featuring our new onboard product is a key component of Air Canada's international expansion plans," continues Mr. Smith. "The fuel efficient Boeing 787 aircraft will open up opportunities for Air Canada to serve new international destinations, and convert existing routes to Dreamliner service, as we continue to renew our fleet and develop Toronto Pearson into a preferred North American gateway and truly global airline hub." 
 Contemporary New Cabin Design 
 With the introduction of the 787 Dreamliner into its widebody fleet, Air Canada is unveiling a contemporary, sophisticated cabin design in a palette of slate grey and neutral tones with accents of Canadian red and celeste blue. 
 The interior decor, cabin architecture and seating in all three cabins - International Business Class, Premium Economy and Economy - have been designed to provide customers with an exceptional travel experience. 
 Highlights of Air Canada's new International Business Class cabin on the 787 Dreamliner include 20 lie-flat Executive Pods with an adjustable pneumatic cushion system that can be extended into a fully flat sleeping position 80 inches in length. New features that enhance the airline's award-winning International Business cabin include: 
 Air Canada's Premium Economy cabin on the 787 Dreamliner has 21 seats in a 2-3-2 configuration providing 38-inch legroom and generous 19.5-inch seat width and 7-inch recline. Each seat is equipped with a 9- or 11-inch enhanced definition intuitive touch personal entertainment screen, as well as universal power and USB outlets. Air Canada's Premium Economy cabin service, unique in North America, offers premium meals, complimentary bar service and priority check-in and baggage delivery at the airport. 
 Air Canada's Economy cabin has 210 slimline seats in a 3-3-3 configuration providing personal space consistent with the comfort of Air Canada's current Economy cabin.

 Boeing 787 Dreamliner: A New Generation in Comfort and Fuel Efficiency 
 Boeing is the world's first major airliner to use composite materials in the construction of its airframe, allowing for significant fuel efficiencies, a more economical long flying range and an enhanced passenger experience with less impact on the environment. Air Canada is the only Canadian carrier to order this new generation aircraft. 
 The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is 20 per cent more fuel efficient than the Boeing 767 aircraft it will replace. 
 The Boeing 787 Dreamliner provides passengers with an unparalleled passenger experience: 
 Air Canada will take delivery of the first of 15 787-8 aircraft in spring 2014. The first delivery of 22 larger capacity 787-9 aircraft is planned for July 2015. All 37 Boeing 787 aircraft are scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2019. 
 As Air Canada takes delivery of new widebody aircraft for its mainline fleet, current Boeing 767 and Airbus A319 aircraft will be transferred to its leisure carrier subsidiary, Air Canada rouge.

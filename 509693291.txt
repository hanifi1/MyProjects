 MONTREAL, Feb. 22, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada confirmed it is business as usual for the airline and that its customers can continue to book Air Canada flights with confidence, following the announcement today of results of a vote by members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW).  The membership did not ratify the tentative agreement reached by the Company and the union's Negotiating Committee on February 10, 2012, and concurrently gave union leadership a strike mandate if a subsequent agreement is not reached.

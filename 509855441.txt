 MONTREAL, March 19, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Following the filing by Aveos Fleet Performance for insolvency protection before the Superior Court of Quebec under the CCAA earlier today, Air Canada has extended to Aveos, through its Court appointed Monitor, FTI Consulting Canada, a $15 million Debtor-in-Possession (DIP) financing, which it will also file on the court record before the presiding judge. The DIP financing, which is substantially similar to an offer extended by Air Canada over the weekend, is intended to assist in stabilizing Aveos for the benefit of its stakeholders and employees, so that it can proceed with a more orderly restructuring. This stabilization should permit Aveos to reopen certain of its facilities and recall certain of its employees, which should in turn allow Air Canada to induct some additional maintenance work with greater confidence over the coming days and weeks. In addition to approval by Aveos, the DIP financing is subject to the approval of the Court.

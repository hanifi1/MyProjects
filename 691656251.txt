MONTREAL, Aug. 24, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced the appointment of Ferio Pugliese as Senior Vice-President, Government Relations and Regional Markets effective August 20, 2018. Mr. Pugliese is succeeding Kevin C. Howlett, Senior Vice-President, Government Relations and Regional Markets, who will be retiring in November after 45 years of dedicated service. Mr. Pugliese will be based in Toronto, and will report directly to Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer.  
"As a global carrier connecting 64 Canadian cities and communities to more than 220 worldwide markets on six continents, one of Air Canada's key priorities is continuing to outreach and strengthen the partnerships we have in the cities and communities we fly to, and our relationships with all levels of government in Canada. Ferio's solid, diverse experience from several Canadian organizations is well-suited to oversee these important relationships, and to also lead the strategic direction of Air Canada's regional operations including our relationships with our regional carriers operating on Air Canada's behalf. I take this opportunity to congratulate Kevin on his upcoming retirement this fall, and thank him for his valuable and tireless work," said Mr. Rovinescu.

MONTREAL, Dec. 3, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced that its leisure carrier subsidiary, Air Canada rouge™, is expanding in Eastern Canada by operating twice daily seasonal non-stop service between Toronto and Charlottetown beginning May 2, 2016. Flights and optional Air Canada Vacations packages are available for purchase at aircanada.com and through travel agents. Air Canada Vacations currently has seven-day vacation packages available for sale from Charlottetown to Sun destinations via Toronto from as low as $847 round-trip, all-in.   
"With the expansion of our leisure carrier rouge to Charlottetown, Air Canada is pleased to offer  over 35 per cent more seats over last summer between Toronto and Charlottetown, just in time for the busy summer travel season," said Benjamin Smith, Air Canada President Passenger Airlines. "By deploying Air Canada rouge on Charlottetown, a popular summer travel destination, Air Canada is reinforcing its commitment to meet the needs of Islanders and the Island's tourism and business community. For over 30 years, Prince Edward Island and visitors have been able to count on Air Canada for year-round and competitive air service connecting the Island with Canada and the world."
"The Charlottetown Airport welcomes Air Canada's decision to bring their Air Canada rouge product to Prince Edward Island", said Airport Authority CEO Doug Newson. "The use of larger Airbus A319 aircraft between Charlottetown and Toronto will provide more capacity for Islanders as well as the thousands of tourists that travel to our beautiful province every year. Air Canada has served Prince Edward Island for several decades and we thank them for continuing to pursue strategic growth options that will have a significant impact on PEI's economy."

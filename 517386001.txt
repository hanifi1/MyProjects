In the future, the new partnership will also allow reciprocal use of frequent flyer programs
MONTREAL and SAO PAULO, March 11, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada and Brazil's GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes announced today a codeshare agreement that will make it easier for customers to connect and travel through the two airlines' networks. The agreement is subject to approval of the Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil, the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica and the Canadian Transportation Agency.
"Air Canada is very pleased to be expanding its global reach through this agreement with Brazil's GOL. The codeshare agreement will enhance our newly-started, three-times-a-week non-stop service to Rio de Janeiro and our non-stop daily service to ‎São Paulo from our Toronto global hub. The codeshare will offer customers even more choice and greater convenience because GOL has an extensive domestic network from these Brazilian gateway cities," said Benjamin Smith, President, Passenger Airlines, at Air Canada.  
"We have invested in partnerships that provide ever-increasing benefits to our customers. The expansion of the partnership with Air Canada is precisely this, and it will also strengthen our presence in international markets," said Ciro Camargo, head of alliances at GOL. 
The two companies currently have an interline agreement that allows customers to make a single reservation for flights on both carriers. The expansion of this partnership under the Codeshare agreement will initially allow Air Canada to include its code on flights operated by GOL, enabling its customers a greater number of connections to destinations and improving network connectivity between the companies. It also provides for a Frequent Flyer Program Agreement which, when concluded, will allow the members of either loyalty program – Aeroplan from Air Canada Smiles from GOL - the ability to accumulate and redeem miles on eligible flights operated by the two carriers.

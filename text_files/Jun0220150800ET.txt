New Targets include:
On track to exceed 2013 Investor Day Targets
MONTRÉAL, June 2, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - As part of a comprehensive strategic plan update to the investment community, Air Canada will establish three new financial targets at its 2015 Investor Day to be held today in Toronto from 09:00 to 12:00 EST.
Building on the success of its business plan, from 2015 until 2018, Air Canada is targeting an annual EBITDAR(1) margin (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment, and aircraft rent, as a percentage of operating revenue) of 15 to 18 percent and a year-over-year return on invested capital (ROIC) (1) of 13 to 16 percent during that period and, by 2018, a leverage ratio(1) of 2.2 (measured by adjusted net debt over normalized EBITDAR).
"We have continued to make significant progress in the execution of our business plan since we first provided the investment community with our financial targets in June 2013," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada. The implementation of our fleet initiatives, capital programs, liquidity targets and debt levels remain on target and we're delivering on a permanently lower cost structure while profitably growing our business, especially our international routes.
"With our growth, we have successfully expanded margins, increased adjusted net income and improved our return on invested capital, thereby creating substantial value for shareholders. We've strengthened our balance sheet, reduced the cost of debt and most significantly achieved all of our objectives in restructuring our pension plans. Now that our pension plans are healthy and in a surplus position, by opting out of the special Air Canada 2014 pension regulations, we expect to free up approximately $1.1 billion in previously allocated deficit funding contributions over the next six years which may now be redeployed to further improve our competitive position and create incremental value.
"In 2013, we set out to achieve some very specific targets relating to our costs per available seat mile (CASM) and ROIC, amongst others. Building on our successful execution against these targets, we are raising the bar with more ambitious objectives and are confident that our new financial targets will be attained.  We will continue our singular focus on the four priorities that have brought us this far - namely, reducing costs and enhancing revenues, profitably growing by leveraging our international network and partnerships, engaging our customers and culture change. Our new targets are significantly higher than those we set out in 2013 and reflect our confidence that we are pursuing the right strategic plan to deliver sustained profitability and value for our shareholders over the long term and that we are executing on it successfully," said Mr. Rovinescu.
At its June 2013 Investor Day, Air Canada had projected that a number of key initiatives, including the roll-out of Air Canada rouge® and the introduction of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, taken together, would drive an estimated 15 percent reduction in CASM by 2018 when compared to 2012. Since its June 2013 Investor Day, the airline added and announced a number of new cost reduction initiatives, including:
Air Canada is on track to exceed the 2013 Investor Day Targets and, taking the added initiatives into account, now estimates that it should realize CASM savings (excluding the impact of foreign exchange and fuel prices) of 21 percent by the end of 2018 when compared to 2012.
In addition, at the end of the first quarter of 2015, unrestricted liquidity was at $3.123 billion (compared to a minimum target of $1.7 billion), ROIC was at 15.2 percent (compared to a target of 10-13 percent) and the airline's leverage ratio, as measured by adjusted net debt over normalized EBITDAR, was at 2.6 (compared to a target ceiling of 3.5).

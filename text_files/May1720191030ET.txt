"Engaging customers and service excellence are key priorities for Air Canada.

Global Traveler conducted a survey of its readers between Oct. 1, 2018 and Jan. 31, 2019, with open-ended questions for the best in many categories of leisure, luxury and lifestyle travel. This survey ran in the magazine, as an insert to subscriber copies, as a direct mail questionnaire, online and via email. Only those questionnaires where more than 50 per cent of the questions were completed were counted. Surveys completed by employees of the magazine or individuals associated with the travel industry were not accepted.

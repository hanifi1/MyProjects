STORY SUMMARY:  Air Canada is pleased to announce this year's Top 10 list of Canada's Best New Restaurants in partnership with American Express. For his fifth year as Air Canada enRoute's restaurant critic, award-winning writer Andrew Braithwaite ate his way across the country, dining in over 30 new restaurants before whittling the contenders down to the ten celebrated at Air Canada's annual gala in Toronto and on CanadasBestNewRestaurants.com. 
The first-place ranking went to Battuto, a 20-seat Italian diner in Quebec City where chef Guillaume St-Pierre and his three-person team dazzle with their creativity and ingenuity in just 400 square feet. Similarly small, chef-run spots nabbed second and third place – Canis in Toronto and Bar Von Der Fels in Calgary, respectively.

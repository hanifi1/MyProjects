Citizens of the World details environmental, social and economic sustainability initiatives
MONTREAL, Aug. 31, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today released the 2014 edition of Citizens of the World, the airline's fourth corporate sustainability report. The document provides an update on Air Canada's performance during 2014 in four key areas of sustainability: safety, the environment, employee well-being, and the company's community involvement. For the first time, Air Canada retained a third-party auditor to assure select indicators in the report to independently verify the company's disclosure. 
"Air Canada has long demonstrated corporate social responsibility through our commitment to safety, our efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, by ensuring the well-being of our employees and in giving back to our communities," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada. "But beyond this, we also want to make it easier for stakeholders to objectively evaluate our company in this area. Citizens of the World does this by reporting on our sustainability activities during the year and making commitments for the next year that we will duly report on.

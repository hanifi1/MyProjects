First Boeing 787 Dreamliner service from Montreal
MONTREAL, Sept. 23, 2016 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced the introduction of daily year-round flights from Montreal to Shanghai, China beginning February 16, 2017. This marks Air Canada's first direct service to China from Montreal as well as the introduction of state-of-the-art Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft on flights departing from Montreal. Tickets will be available for purchase on aircanada.com and through travel agents on September 28. All Air Canada flights provide for Aeroplan accumulation and redemption and, for eligible customers, priority check-in, Maple Leaf Lounge access, priority boarding and other benefits.
"Building on Air Canada's success in the rapidly growing Chinese market we are delighted to announce Air Canada's first direct flights between Montreal and China with the launch of Montreal-Shanghai service next year," said Calin Rovinescu, Air Canada's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "This also marks the introduction of Air Canada's first 787 Dreamliner aircraft service from Montreal, further underlining our commitment to expand our global reach and reinforce Montreal-Trudeau as a strategic hub. With today's announcement, Air Canada has increased its international capacity from Montreal by 133 per cent since 2009, with direct service to 13 cities in Europe, North Africa and China.
"China is Canada's second largest trading partner and Air Canada has made a significant investment of more than $1 billion in aircraft and equipment allocated specifically to serve the Chinese market from our Canadian hubs. We will be the first and only Canadian carrier to operate daily non-stop transpacific service between Montreal and the Asia-Pacific region, and with an elapsed time of 14.5 hours, it will be the longest flight ever operated by any carrier from Montréal-Trudeau airport. Together with our Star Alliance partners, Air China and Shenzhen Airlines, and partner Juneyao Airlines, a Shanghai based airline operating to more than 30 destinations in China, we will offer the growing number of travellers between Montreal and China even more convenient travel options to Chinese destinations," concluded Mr. Rovinescu.
"This new Montreal-Shanghai non-stop Air Canada service will help deepen our already strong people-to-people ties with China. It will also help boost tourism, trade and the economy and offer more choice for Canadian consumers. Today's announcement comes at an important time in Canada-China relations as demonstrated by the two back-to-back Leaders' visits over the past three weeks," stated Stéphane Dion, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada, and Member of Parliament for Saint-Laurent."This new direct link between Montréal and Shanghai will not only make life easier for travelers, it will also encourage trade. Easier access to this new market will help foster economic development in our communities. Today's announcement is a testament to the relationship our governments have forged in recent years," said Quebec Minister of Economy, Science, Innovation and Minister responsible for Digital Strategy, Dominique Anglade.
"During Montreal's economic mission to China last year, the mayor of Shanghai and I renewed our twinning agreement by committing to strengthening our economic and commercial exchanges and continuing to work towards providing direct airline service between our two cities. I am certain today's announcement will generate significant economic opportunities, giving our organizations greater access to new markets and helping to attract foreign businesses that will create jobs for Canadians," stated Denis Coderre, Mayor of Montreal.
"Aéroports de Montréal wishes to sincerely thank Air Canada, which has spared no effort to develop its international network out of our airport and to create jobs and economic spinoffs locally. The launch of this daily non-stop flight between Montréal and Shanghai is further proof of this," said James Cherry, President and CEO, Aéroports de Montréal.
"As an important partner, Tourisme Montréal is thrilled about the improved air service between our city and China, a major tourism market for Montreal. This is an important strategic initiative for Tourisme Montréal. It is with determination that we will pursue our objective and ensure the continuity of these services, and that we will keep promoting Montréal as a choice tourism destination in other Asian markets," stated Yves Lalumière, CEO of Tourisme Montréal.
In Montreal, flights are timed to optimize connections to and from the carrier's extensive Eastern Canada and U.S. networks including Ottawa, Quebec City, Halifax, New York and Boston.
In Shanghai, Star Alliance partners Air China and Shenzhen Airlines, along with our partner Juneyao Airlines with whom we will launch an interline agreement in the coming weeks, offer excellent connectivity to domestic China destinations such as Chengdu, Chongqing and Shenzhen.

Backgrounder
Air Canada at Montréal-Trudeau Airport (YUL)
Air Canada, a major corporation headquartered in Montreal since 1949, is the largest airline in Canada and among the 20 largest air carriers in the world.
The airline employs 5,500 employees in Montreal and in 2016, for the third year in a row, was named among the top employers in Montreal and recognized for its involvement in the community through the Air Canada Foundation among several other criteria.
Including employees of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Air Canada Vacations, its leisure carrier Air Canada rouge and its two Air Canada Express commercial partners, Jazz and Sky Regional, which operate flights exclusively for Air Canada, the Company employs over 7,000 individuals in the Montreal area.
Montréal-Trudeau Airport (YUL) is a strategic hub for Air Canada and international gateway, connecting its Québec and Atlantic Canada domestic network, with its U.S. transborder, Caribbean, European and the Air Canada North African route.
Air Canada, Air Canada rouge and its regional airline partners flying under the Air Canada Express banner operate on average approximately 2,100 flights per week between Montreal and 80 destinations: 23 in Canada including nine in Québec, 18 in the United States, 26 in the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico, 12 in Europe, and one in North Africa. 
Montréal-Trudeau gateway to French speaking destinations 
Air Canada provides service in both of Canada's official languages. As a fully bilingual operation, Montréal-Trudeau Airport is a strategic hub for Air Canada, an international gateway connecting its Québec and Atlantic Canada domestic network, with its U.S., Caribbean, European and only North African route. It plays a special role in connecting Canada with many French-speaking communities in the world, known as la francophonie, reflecting Montreal's unique character, with service to points throughout Québec and New Brunswick among other provinces, as well as to and from France (Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle, Nice and Lyon), Switzerland (Geneva), Belgium (Brussels), Martinique, Guadeloupe, Haiti and since June 2016 Casablanca.
Air Canada Offers most non-stop flights to the U.S.

Easy connections for international travelers flying to and from the U.S.
It has never been easier to connect in Montreal to Air Canada's global network including Paris, Geneva, Brussels and, beginning this summer Lyon and Casablanca. In addition to the introduction of our new international services from Montreal to Europe, Asia and North Africa, we are also seeing that international travelers are increasingly finding that connecting through Montreal on Air Canada is the most convenient way to fly to and from the U.S.

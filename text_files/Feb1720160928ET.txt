Air Canada to Collaborate in Establishment of Centre of Excellence for C Series Aircraft Maintenance 
MONTREAL, Febr. 17, 2016 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said that further to its earlier announcement today of a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Bombardier Inc. for the acquisition of up to 75 Bombardier C Series 300 aircraft, it has agreed to have its C Series airframe heavy maintenance work performed in Quebec by a recognized maintenance provider for a minimum of 20 years from first delivery in 2019. It is expected that Air Canada's commitment in this regard will help establish a Centre of Excellence for C Series aircraft maintenance in the province. As a result, subject to completion of final agreements, the Government of Quebec has agreed to discontinue the litigation related to Air Canada's obligations regarding the maintenance of an overhaul and operational centre.

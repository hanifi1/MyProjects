 New Seoul and Istanbul routes; seven more weekly flights to China; Calgary-Narita upgrade  
 MONTREAL, Nov. 29, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada is bringing the world closer this summer with a major expansion of its international services. The carrier is launching a new non-stop route between Toronto and Seoul, starting service to Istanbul subject to government approval, adding seven weekly departures to Beijing from Toronto and Vancouver, and upgrading its Calgary-Tokyo Narita route to provide daily service. 
 "Air Canada is seizing the opportunities of the Pacific Century with the most far-reaching international expansion of its schedule in its 75-year history. Our new routes embrace the world from Istanbul to Seoul and deepen our already extensive Asian service. With our Asia expansion alone, we will be flying 11 daily departures or more than 43,000 seats a week across the Pacific Ocean this summer - a commitment of up to 14 widebody aircraft valued in excess of $2 billion. Our service to Istanbul, the bridge between Europe and Asia, adds an exciting destination to the Air Canada network with easy connections throughout Turkey and points in Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa with our Star Alliance partner Turkish Airlines," said Ben Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. "Customers will enjoy flying on the Best International Airline in North America as rated for three straight years by the influential Skytrax World Airline Awards. All flights will offer lie flat suites in Executive First, industry-leading seatback entertainment throughout all aircraft, the ability to collect and redeem Aeroplan mileage and lounge access and concierge service for eligible customers."

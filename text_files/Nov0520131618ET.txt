 "I am pleased to report a load factor of 81.3 per cent for the month of October, Air Canada's second highest load factor on record for the month," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Traffic grew overall by 1.3 per cent led by domestic Canada and U.S. transborder markets.  We continue to implement our strategy to build a strong global network.  In October, we concluded an enhanced cooperation agreement with the Greater Toronto Airports Authority to further develop Toronto Pearson as a truly global hub and even stronger North American gateway.  I would like to thank our employees for their focus on taking care of our customers while transporting them safely to their destination throughout the year.  In an annual survey of Canadian businesses announced in October, Air Canada was named as one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, and just recently Air Canada was named one of Canada's Safest Employers in recognition of outstanding achievements in workplace health and safety.  Air Canada is proud to be recognized for these achievements as a progressive employer with safety as our number one priority."

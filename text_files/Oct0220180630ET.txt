MONTREAL, Oct. 2, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today commended the Governments of Canada, the United States and Mexico on reaching a new trade agreement, thereby removing much of the uncertainty overhanging trade and business between the three countries.
"While the details of the agreement need to be fully assessed, the proposed USMCA should not only promote greater trade and economic stability, but also provide numerous opportunities for future growth," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive of Air Canada.

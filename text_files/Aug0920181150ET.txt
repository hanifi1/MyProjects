Top 10 to be revealed in November issue of Air Canada enRoute Magazine
TORONTO, Aug. 9, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ -Â Air Canada is proud to present the 30 nominees for Canada's Best New Restaurants presented by American Express. The highly anticipated longlist, drawn from a coast-to-coast culinary exploration, is out today on CanadasBestNewRestaurants.com.
From an Italian-inflected seafood menu in a beachy Halifax room to the wildly creative charcuterie cabinet of a French bistro in Victoria, this year's finalists celebrate the delectable diversity of Canadian cuisine. Based on the recommendations from a panel of food experts, Air Canada sends one writer on an anonymous, month-long, cross-country dining marathon to determine the most notable new openings that become contenders for the coveted annual Top 10 list.
"For over 15 years, Air Canada has been committed to discovering the latest Canadian culinary innovations and dining destinations, and celebrating the central role they play in our customers' travel experience," says Andy Shibata, Managing Director, Brand, Air Canada. "This year, we want to celebrate diversity in Canada's culinary culture and highlight chefs and restaurateurs with global backgrounds. Their achievements will be honoured and featured online and in Air Canada's enRoute onboard magazine."
"Our Cardmembers are passionate about food and look to us to point them towards the country's best restaurants and chefs," says David Barnes, VP of Advertising and Communications, American Express Canada. "That's why it's a natural fit for us to pair with Air Canada and sponsor Canada's Best New Restaurants for the fourth year running. We're so excited about the contenders on this list this year."

To date, 4ocean has removed more than six million pounds of trash from the ocean and coastlines. Drawing on their years of experience, 4ocean will also participate with the Air Canada team to develop educational resources on ocean conservation. These cleanups are in line with Air Canada's single-use plastics reduction strategy and help the airline meet its goal to leave less and do more for the environment.

MONTREAL, Dec. 5, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - The busy holiday travel season is around the corner with a peak expected between December 19, 2018 and January 5, 2019. To make your travel experience as smooth as possible, Air Canada recommends these six essential travel tips.
1. Save time. Check-in 24 hours in advance.
Check-in online at aircanada.com, mobile.aircanada.ca or via the Air Canada app (be sure to download the app for iOS or Android). You can also select/change your seat, select the number of checked baggage and pay any baggage fees in advance.
Be sure to provide your contact information (email or mobile number) when checking-in (mobile‎/kiosk/web) so that we can contact you in case of travel disruptions.  If you've booked with a travel agent, please ensure they've included your contact information on your booking.  
For added fun, you can register your child for Air Canada's Skyriders (skyriders.aircanada.com) program to help them track their travels. Each child gets a Skyriders starter kit that consists of a friendly introduction letter, a sturdy luggage tag and a logbook to keep a record of each one of their flights.

2. Is your flight on time? Confirm online 24/7 at aircanada.com/flightnotification or via the Air Canada app.
You can stay informed of flight status for all Air Canada, Air Canada Rouge and Air Canada Express flights by signing up for Flight Notifications or calling the toll-free Air Canada flight status line at 1-888-422-7533; TTY (Hearing Impaired): 1-800-361-8071.
We also post a Daily Travel Outlook that lists possible flight disruptions due to forecasted weather or other events and provides a link to a self-service rebooking tool.
3. Arrive early. Here's when: aircanada.com/deadlines.
Arrive early at the airport to be at the gate on time and avoid congestion that may occur during peak periods. If you are travelling to the US, please arrive 3 hours prior to departure to clear customs as well.
4. Review baggage rules. Here's what to carry-on and check-in.
Check size and weight allowances when packing at aircanada.com/carryon as carry-on baggage will be screened and tagged. Information on checked baggage allowance is available at: www.aircanada.com/checked.
Consider bringing a bag that will fit under the seat in front of you as space in the overhead bins is limited. We also strongly recommend checking any bags that do not fit into our sizers to make the boarding process more efficient and prevent delays.
Bring all valuables including electronics, documentation, medication, car keys, money and jewelry in carry-on bags and not in checked bags.
Bag Tags – Place identification INSIDE bags as well as on the outside, as external baggage name tags sometimes become detached.
Gifts – when travelling with gifts in your carry-on, remember to keep them unwrapped to facilitate security inspection.
5. Check your documentation. Avoid unnecessary surprises before your vacation takes off. Ensure that all your travel documents are valid at: aircanada.com/traveldocumentation.

About the Lockheed L-10A ElectraThe Lockheed L‐10A Electra was designed in the mid-1930s by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, to compete against the Boeing 247 and the Douglas DC‐2. This was Lockheed's first all‐metal twin engine aircraft design, and was first flown on February 23rd, 1934. 
Although the aircraft was operated by many commercial airlines in the 1930s, the Lockheed Electra was made most famous by aviatrix Amelia Earhart, who in 1937, disappeared in her L-10E Electra while attempting an around‐the‐world flight. The only difference between the two models is that the L‐10E was equipped with larger, more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney R1340 engines.
Trans Canada Air Lines and the Lockheed L-10AOn September 1st, 1937 Air Canada's forerunner, Trans Canada Air Lines (TCA), launched its first commercial passenger flight; a fifty-minute trip from Vancouver to Seattle. TCA had acquired the route plus two Lockheed L‐10A aircraft from Canadian Airways.

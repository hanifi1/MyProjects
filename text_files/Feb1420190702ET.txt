MONTREAL, Feb. 14, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced strategic changes to Eastern Canada including upgrading Air Canada Express regional aircraft to larger Air Canada Rouge aircraft with inflight amenities on its flights from Toronto to Fredericton, Moncton and Thunder Bay, and from Montreal to St. John's. 
"Air Canada is upgrading key Eastern Canada routes currently operated with all-economy regional aircraft by deploying larger Air Canada Rouge jets which offer a choice of two cabins, wi-fi and in-flight entertainment streamed to personal devices," said Mark Galardo, Vice President, Network Planning at Air Canada. "We are pleased to add more travel options to and from Newfoundland and Labrador by increasing capacity on our flights to St. John's via our Montreal hub which offers excellent connections to and from our extensive North American and global network. With our varied and flexible fleet, we are also adding capacity to our popular Calgary-Halifax seasonal flight with larger mainline Airbus A320 aircraft, with connections in Calgary conveniently linking eastern and western Canada."

MONTREAL, April 2, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - On March 31, at a public consultation for the Master Plan for the Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport by the Toronto Port Authority (also known as Ports Toronto), the following became clear:
"Air Canada's position on this matter is crystal clear," stated Derek Vanstone, Air Canada's Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Government and Industry Affairs:
No Jets
"We do not support jets at Billy Bishop - we prefer to see a growing downtown airport focused on short haul passengers using modern turboprop aircraft, which would be more consistent with the spirit and intent of the original tripartite agreement at Billy Bishop. Port Toronto's focus on jets is not defensible as Billy Bishop can certainly prosper and grow as a turboprop airport, serving communities within the two hour range that can be accomplished with Toronto-assembled Bombardier Q400 aircraft."
Access to Slots
"We want fair and appropriate access to slots for Air Canada and other carriers to encourage real competition at Billy Bishop, similar to the situation that we find at other airports across the country where Porter has the ability to commence jet service at any time.  Currently, Porter Airlines has been awarded over 85% of the slots and we are unable to serve more than one market, Montreal, despite huge demand from our customers for Ottawa, New York / Newark and other short haul markets.  Moreover, if the slot growth at the airport was capped as proposed, and even if Air Canada was awarded all of these outstanding slots, it would be insufficient to allow us to commence even the most basic level of service to these new destinations.  Indeed, slot caps of the sort being advanced by Ports Toronto can only benefit Porter and enhance its existing dominant position."

MONTREAL, June 7, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today it has begun offering next-generation, satellite connectivity on its wide-body international fleet with the introduction of Air Canada Wi-Fi provided by Gogo. Starting with flights operated by Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, the new service will be the fastest available on any Canadian airline and makes Air Canada the first Canadian carrier to offer customers the ability to stream TV and movies in-flight through the internet.
"Air Canada customers on international wide-body flights will have access to the fastest internet service available on any Canadian carrier. Air Canada Wi-Fi will make traveling more enjoyable whether you're connecting with family and friends, watching a favorite movie or TV program on the internet, or scrolling through your social media feeds. The speed and reliability of Air Canada Wi-Fi will also make it an excellent productivity tool for business travelers, who will be able to keep in touch and work during their journey so they can stay up-to-date and arrive fully prepared for any meeting or event," said Benjamin Smith, President, Passenger Airlines, at Air Canada. 
Air Canada Satellite Wi-Fi is now available on the airline's Boeing 777-300ER aircraft and on Air Canada Rouge's narrow-body fleet. The entire Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge wide-body fleet – including the Boeing 777-200LR, 787-8/9 and Airbus 330 and Air Canada Rouge Boeing 767-300ER – is scheduled to be equipped with the system by mid-2019.

Traffic increased 8.4 per cent in the month
MONTRÉAL, Feb. 4, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - For the month of January, Air Canada reported a record system load factor of 80.1 per cent, versus 80 per cent in January 2014, on a system-wide capacity increase of 8.3 per cent. On this additional capacity, system wide traffic for January increased 8.4 per cent. Air Canada reports traffic results on a system-wide basis, including regional airlines from which Air Canada purchases capacity and Air Canada rougeTM.
"I am pleased to report a record load factor of 80.1 per cent for the month of January," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer. "System wide, traffic grew 8.4 per cent led by significant growth in the Atlantic, U.S. transborder, Latin American and Caribbean markets. On the Pacific, as expected, much of the difference in traffic from the previous year is attributed to Chinese New Year travel falling in February this year versus January and February 2014. Additionally, we carried an unprecedented volume of passengers for the month. These strong results underscore the effectiveness of our commercial strategy focusing on international growth and the strategic execution of our plan. I would like to thank our employees for their hard work taking care of our customers while transporting them safely to their destinations despite the challenges of severe winter weather."

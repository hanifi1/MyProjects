MONTREAL, Sept. 13, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada's Four-Star rating has been affirmed by Skytrax, the international air transport rating organization whose research is used for benchmarking in the global airline industry. The rating is based on assessment of more than 1,000 aspects of the airline's airport and onboard products and services and makes Air Canada the only Four-Star, full-service international carrier in North America, a distinction first earned in 2013.
"We are delighted that Skytrax has re-affirmed Air Canada's Four-Star rating and we are proud to be the only international network carrier in North America to hold this coveted distinction. These results validate our strategy to invest in our onboard and airport products, services and people. In particular, we are thrilled that Skytrax concluded our new Air Canada Signature Suite at Toronto-Pearson 'can now be considered amongst the best, if not the best in the world for Business Class' pre-flight dining," said Lucie Guillemette, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, at Air Canada. 
"The Skytrax ranking equally reflects the professionalism and dedication of our employees, who work very hard every day to deliver elevated service to our customers. All 30,000 of us at Air Canada are committed to further improve our product offerings so that our customers can continue to enjoy a memorable and unique experience whenever they fly Air Canada."

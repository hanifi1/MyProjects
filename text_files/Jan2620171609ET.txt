MONTREAL, Jan. 26, 2017 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has been recognized by the Finance and Sustainability Initiative (FSI) with the "2017 Award for Best Corporate Sustainability Report - Transportation" in Canada. This annual competition aims to promote excellence in sustainable development reporting among Canadian public companies. 
Air Canada was selected to receive this honour for its 2015 Corporate Social Responsibility Report, Citizens of the World, updated annually on www.aircanada.com/csr. The airline's fifth corporate sustainability report details Air Canada's performance during 2015 in four key areas of sustainability: safety, the environment, employee well-being, and the company's community involvement.
It was prepared in accordance with principles of the Global Reporting Initiative G4 guidelines, an internationally recognized standard for sustainability reporting. To further validate the report, Air Canada took the extra step of retaining a third-party auditor to assure select indicators and independently verify the company's disclosure. The report is framed around the findings of an extensive stakeholder survey to identify areas of most concern with respect to sustainability.  It also contains a discussion of governance practices at Air Canada and tables of data quantifying the results of our sustainability activities. Highlights of 2015 include:
The Finance and Sustainability Initiative (FSI) is a Montreal-based non-profit organization that brings together finance professionals dedicated to promoting sustainable finance and, more specifically, responsible investment to financial institutions, companies, and universities.  More information is available at www.ifd-fsi.org.

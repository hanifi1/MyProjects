Airline has six-year agreement to transport all seven Canadian hockey teams
MONTREAL, Sept. 23, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada is proudly doing its part to lift a Canadian team to a Stanley Cup victory as this year's hockey season gets underway. Beginning this month, the airline will carry all seven Canadian teams under six-year agreements to provide air transportation through Air Canada Jetz, the airline's in-house, all-Premium charter service operated by mainline Air Canada pilots and flight attendants.
The six-year agreements begin at the start of the 2015-16 season and cover the Montreal Canadiens, the Ottawa Senators, the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Winnipeg Jets, the Calgary Flames, the Edmonton Oilers and the Vancouver Canucks. In addition, the Toronto Blue Jays also have a six-year agreement with Air Canada. The services will be operated by Jetz, Air Canada's in-house charter carrier, which uses Airbus A319 aircraft outfitted with 58-Premium seats to offer extra legroom and a private jet-like experience.

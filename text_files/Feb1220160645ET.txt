MONTREAL, Feb. 12, 2016 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada said today that it welcomes confirmation by the Canadian Airline Dispatchers Association (CALDA) that its members have ratified a new contract on collective agreement terms for 12 years. Air Canada's flight dispatchers are based at the airline's Operations Centre near Toronto Pearson International Airport and assist flight crew in the preparation for flight departures and arrivals. 
"The ratification of this new 12-year contract with our flight dispatchers, the seventh of our employee groups to do so over the past year and a half, is an unprecedented achievement that recognizes the important contribution of our employees and underscores the transformative change that has taken place at Air Canada," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive of Air Canada. "Moreover, these agreements provide Air Canada with added stability and flexibility to support long-term and profitable growth at the airline that is beneficial for all stakeholders."

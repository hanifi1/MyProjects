 MONTREAL, Feb. 23, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today welcomed the BC Minister of Transport's announcement to eliminate the provincial aviation fuel tax for international flights from British Columbia. 
 "We applaud the BC government for their progressive actions in eliminating the provincial aviation fuel tax on international flights. In addition, we thank the Vancouver Airport Authority for their initiative to hold in line landing and terminal fees until 2015. These types of initiatives help contribute to the competitiveness of the Canadian aviation landscape in the global marketplace," said Ben Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. 
 "Following the progressive example now set by the Province of BC and in 2004 by the Province of Alberta, we urge all governments and authorities to work with the industry as partners in the development of sustainable air services with the economic spin-offs that result."

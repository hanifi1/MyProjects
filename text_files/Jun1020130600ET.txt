 MONTREAL, June 10, 2013 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada will discuss its plans for pursuing sustainable improvement in profitability and shareholder value at its 2013 Investor Day to be held today in Toronto from 08:30 to 12:30 EST. A live, listen-only audio webcast of the event will be available through a link on Air Canada's website at www.aircanada.com (Investors section), along with accompanying presentation slides. 
 Air Canada reported 2012 EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment, and aircraft rent), excluding benefit plan amendments, of $1.3 billion and adjusted net income of $55 million and the price of its common shares increased by 76 per cent over that year. It is management's plan to continue improving on these results. 
 "Our focus will remain on the execution of our strategic priorities to continue to transform Air Canada into a sustainably profitable airline," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We continue to reduce costs, develop new sources of revenue, reduce indebtedness and improve the customer experience while adapting to the competitive environment. We have confidence our financial plan can earn a return on invested capital that exceeds its weighted average cost of capital and reward shareholders far into the future." 
 Key points to be covered at the conference include Air Canada's:

 Current Outlook 
 For the second quarter of 2013, Air Canada continues to expect its system ASM capacity, as measured by available seat miles (ASMs), to increase in the range of 2.0 to 3.0 per cent when compared to the second quarter of 2012. 
 Air Canada expects its full year 2013 system ASM capacity to increase in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent when compared to the full year 2012.  Air Canada expects its full year 2013 domestic capacity to increase in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent from the full year 2012 (as opposed to the increase of 0.5 to 1.5 per cent projected in Air Canada's news release dated May 3, 2013).  The increase in projected domestic capacity is due to schedule changes. 
 For the second quarter of 2013, Air Canada expects adjusted CASM to decrease 0.5 to 1.5 per cent when compared to the second quarter of 2012 (as opposed to the range of a decrease of 0.5 per cent to an increase of 0.5 per cent projected in Air Canada's news release dated May 3, 2013).  The improved CASM projection is largely due to expected cost saving benefits from tactical initiatives. 
 Air Canada expects its full year 2013 adjusted CASM to decrease in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 per cent from the full year 2012. 
 In addition, Air Canada plans to increase its full year 2014 system capacity by 9.0 to 11.0 per cent when compared to the full year 2013.  This projected increase in capacity is consistent with the fleet plan discussed in Air Canada's First Quarter 2013 MD&amp;A and is largely due to the addition of five high-density Boeing 777-300ER aircraft scheduled for delivery between June 2013 and February 2014, the scheduled arrival in 2014 of the first seven Boeing 787 aircraft and the planned growth from Air Canada rougeTM. 
 Air Canada's outlook assumes Canadian GDP growth of 1.25 to 1.75 per cent for 2013 and Canadian GDP growth of 2.0 to 3.0 per cent for 2014. 
 Air Canada also expects that the Canadian dollar will trade, on average, at C$1.03 per U.S. dollar for the second quarter of 2013 and for the full year 2013 and that the price of jet fuel will average 84 cents per litre in the second quarter of 2013 and 85 cents per litre for the full year 2013. 
 The following table summarizes Air Canada's above-mentioned outlook for the second quarter and full year 2013 and related major assumptions: 
 For the full year 2013, Air Canada also expects:

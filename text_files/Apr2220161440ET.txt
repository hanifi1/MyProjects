MONTREAL, April 22, 2016 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced today it is celebrating Earth Day with employee and community events to highlight its commitment to the environment and its continuing efforts to reduce its footprint. Since 1990 Air Canada has improved fleet fuel efficiency by 38 per cent, and in 2015 alone its fuel saving initiatives are estimated to have reduced fuel consumption by approximately 11,000 tonnes.
"As a global company, Air Canada regards itself as a citizen of the world and we therefore take our environmental responsibilities seriously, especially with respect to reducing emissions that contribute to global warming. Not only is this the right thing to do, it is something our employees and other stakeholders ask of us, so we are pleased to include them in our celebration of Earth Day," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada. "We have pledged to meet the collective industry goal of carbon neutral growth by 2020 and reduce emissions 50 per cent by 2050 relative to 2005.  We are well on the way to achieving these goals, having improved our fuel efficiency by nearly 10 per cent since 2009 alone."

MONTREAL, June 9, 2017 /CNW Telbec/ - The departure of flight AC1962 from Montreal-Trudeau airport tonight will mark the successful launch of Air Canada Rouge's newest route. The seasonal, non-stop service between Montreal and Marseille will operate three times a week during the summer and give Air Canada customers even more choices when travelling to France.
"The Marseille service will be the only non-stop flight operated by a network carrier between Marseille and North America further expanding Air Canada's reach in France by complementing existing services to Paris, Lyon and Nice, and strengthening our presence in Provence-Côte d'Azur, a popular summer destination for Quebecers," said Benjamin Smith, President, Passenger Airlines at Air Canada.

MONTREAL, Feb. 6, 2020 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has introduced a new payment option for customers by enabling them to use PayPal when purchasing tickets online at aircanada.com in Canada. The popular online payment system offers a secure and convenient means to buy tickets, with customers able to pay for their flights with their preferred payment method – bank account, credit cards or Visa Debit card – linked to their PayPal account. 
"Air Canada's strategy is to continually provide customers the opportunity to make their purchase using their preferred method of payment. We are therefore pleased to announce our agreement with PayPal, the popular online payment system that is secure, fast and convenient to use. Having now made PayPal available for ticket sales in Canada, we will look to expand the program to other markets as opportunities arise," said Keith Wallis, Senior Director, Payments and Distribution, at Air Canada.
"We're excited to add Air Canada—our first airline partner in Canada—to a growing fleet of airlines across the globe that leverage our global e-commerce platform to expand their reach," said Paul Parisi, PayPal Canada President. "Our two companies share the same goal to provide a great checkout experience for travellers, so they spend less time buying tickets online and more time enjoying their trip."
PayPal has more than 300 million active users worldwide.

 MONTREAL, Sept. 5, 2013 /CNW Telbec/ - For the month of August, Air Canada reported a record system load factor of 89.5 per cent, versus 87.9 per cent in August 2012, an increase of 1.6 percentage points.  System traffic increased 4.7 per cent on a system-wide capacity increase of 2.9 per cent. Air Canada reports traffic results on a system-wide basis, including Air Canada rouge, which began operations on July 1, 2013, and regional airlines from which Air Canada purchases capacity. 
 "I am pleased to report a record load factor of 89.5 per cent for the month of August," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "The increase in our load factor by 1.6 percentage points over the prior year underscores the effectiveness of our capacity management strategy. System wide, traffic grew 4.7 per cent, led by the Pacific, Atlantic and domestic Canada markets. This is the eighth consecutive month Air Canada has set new records system-wide for passengers boarded, and on August 15 we achieved a new single day record of 127,100 customers. During the month, we successfully completed the transfer of all 15 Embraer 175 aircraft to Sky Regional, our Air Canada Express partner, an important step in Air Canada's regional diversification strategy and our ongoing cost transformation program. I thank our employees for maintaining their focus on our operational performance which continues to show year-over-year improvements, while taking care of our customers and transporting them safely to their destination during this peak travel season."

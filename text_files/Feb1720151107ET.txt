MONTREAL, Feb. 17, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has been named the leading airline in customer loyalty, according to Brand Keys 2015 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index® (CLEI).  The 19th annual survey, conducted by independent marketing research firm, Brand Keys, measures a brand's ability to meet customers' expectations better than the competition.
For the 2015 index, New York-based Brand Keys surveyed more than 36,000 U.S. and Canadian consumers, ages 18 to 65, and examined 540 brands in 64 categories to measure the degrees of loyalty that consumers exhibit toward their favourite brands.
"Recognition of Air Canada as the number one airline for customer loyalty in North America is a tremendous honour," said Craig Landry, Air Canada's Vice President, Marketing. "Brand Keys' research findings speak to Air Canada's focus on engaging customers and our continuing investments in world class products and services. In addition, this ranking recognizes our employees for their hard work and professionalism taking care of customers to earn their loyalty."
"In a marketplace where consumers are looking to be delighted, according to this year's Customer Loyalty Engagement Index, Air Canada has been better able to deliver against the very high expectations flyers hold for the Airline category," added Robert Passikoff, President of Brand Keys. "Air Canada's ability to better address customers' emotional values has resulted in increased levels of customer engagement and loyalty. Brands able to do that generally see the highest levels of loyalty and positive behavior over the next 12 to 18 months. It is a tribute to Air Canada that they have accomplished this in such a highly challenging category – better than the competitors.  We congratulate Air Canada, their management, and employees for being #1 this year."

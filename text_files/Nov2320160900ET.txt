MONTREAL, Nov. 23, 2016 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has introduced a brand new kids' club called Air Canada Altitude Skyriders™ designed to make flights even more exciting and enjoyable for children between the ages of two and 12 years old. Once parents register their children for free online at Air Canada Altitude Skyriders, children will receive a kit containing a welcome letter, an exclusive Skyriders luggage tag and a logbook to chart their flights. Every time the child travels, he or she will also earn printable badges online to commemorate special milestones or achievements. First flights, new regions or destinations explored all have special meaning, and will be commemorated online. E-mail notifications will be sent once new badges are earned.

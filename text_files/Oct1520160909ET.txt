MONTREAL, Oct. 15, 2016 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced that as result of new regulations in Canada and the U.S. prohibiting Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices aboard commercial aircraft, it will not permit the devices aboard its aircraft effective immediately.
Travellers will not be permitted to board Air Canada, Air Canada Rouge or Air Canada Express aircraft with this device on their person or in their checked luggage. Customers arriving at the airport with the device and attempting to travel could experience travel disruptions and possibly miss their flight. 
Air Canada appreciates this may be inconvenient for customers. For those who arrive at the airport with a Samsung Galaxy Note 7, Air Canada has put in place a goodwill policy to enable customers to travel at another time without penalty to allow them to make alternative arrangements for their device.

Quebec City's Battuto takes the number-one spot as Canada's Best New Restaurant
TORONTO, Oct. 19, 2017 /CNW/ - AirÂ Canada is pleased to announce this year's Top 10 list of Canada's Best New Restaurants in partnership with American Express. For his fifth year as Air Canada enRoute's restaurant critic, award-winning writer Andrew Braithwaite ate his way across the country, dining in over 30 new restaurants before whittling the contenders down to the ten celebrated today at Air Canada's annual gala in Toronto and on CanadasBestNewRestaurants.com.
The first-place ranking went to Battuto, a 20-seat Italian diner in Quebec City where chef Guillaume St-Pierre and his three-person team dazzle with their creativity and ingenuity in just 400 square feet. Similarly small, chef-run spots nabbed second and third place â€“ Canis in Toronto and Bar Von Der Fels in Calgary, respectively. "Restaurants were sized down in 2017," says Braithwaite, "and smaller rooms shrink the distance between these talented chefs and our taste buds â€“ so we diners spend more time interacting with a restaurant's best people."
But Edmonton was the surprise of the year, with a record three restaurants making the list: Clementine, CafÃ© Linnea and Alder Room. "Edmonton felt like a different city than the one I'd visited on my four previous tours, and the new hockey arena is a game-changer," noted Braithwaite. "The cocktail scene has always been strong, and there's clearly a passion for creating art on the plate, too."
"For the 16th year running, Air Canada is delighted to help shine a global light on Canada's incredible food and drink culture, especially with this year marking Canada's 150th anniversary," says Andy Shibata, Managing Director, Brand, Air Canada. "We are proud to celebrate the ingenious chefs and restaurateurs across the country and are committed to sharing valuable travel and dining experiences and insights with our customers."
From plums masquerading as olives at Alder Room in Edmonton to a tangle of Humboldt squid parading as slippery udon noodles at Canis in Toronto, magic was a common theme among this year's winners. Brunch crossed over, with champagne and toast soldiers for breakfast at Edmonton's CafÃ© Linnea and a buckwheat crepe with aged egg yolk for dinner at Mak N Ming in Vancouver. Chefs also took the art of fermentation way beyond sourdough, applying it to carrot juice, shishito-jang and even ice cream. And they got serious about music, too, curating their own Spotify playlists that are as idiosyncratic as their wine lists.

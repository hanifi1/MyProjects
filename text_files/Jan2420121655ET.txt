 MONTREAL, Jan. 24, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada confirmed today that it remains at the negotiating table awaiting a response from ACPA, the union representing its pilots, to a comprehensive proposal tabled by the Company on Monday January 16, 2012. 
 Air Canada has been in negotiations with ACPA since October 2010. Following the rejection of a first tentative agreement reached in May 2011, the Company waited six months for ACPA to return to the negotiating table. The two sides have now been in discussions assisted by a federally-appointed conciliator since early November 2011. 
 Following two separate extensions to the conciliation timeline, the negotiation process is advancing to mediation, as permitted by the Canada Labour Code. In this phase, the conciliator will assume the role of mediator and will continue to oversee the process to bring to conclusion the talks started in late 2010. 
 Contrary to certain allegations by union representatives, Air Canada is not abandoning its efforts to negotiate a new contract with its pilots. Indeed, Air Canada remains at the table awaiting a response to its most recent offer. In light of two separate recent extensions to the conciliation period, it is also inaccurate to say that Air Canada has refused requests to extend conciliation timelines.

 CHARLOTTETOWN, PEI, May 28, 2014 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced that it will further adjust its schedule to offer more capacity to and from Charlottetown, PEI during the peak summer travel months with a 21 per cent total overall increase in available seats over last summer. In addition to the previously announced third Montreal daily flight, the added capacity is provided by the use of the larger Bombardier CRA 705 aircraft on three of its four daily flights to Toronto-Pearson. 
 "In response to increased demand created by the 150th anniversary celebrations of the 1864 Charlottetown conference, Air Canada will offer over 100 more seats each way every day to and from the Island for the months of July and August," said Kevin Howlett, Senior Vice President Regional Markets, Air Canada. "With its diversified fleet, Air Canada has a unique ability to react quickly and adapt its schedule further reinforcing its commitment to the specific needs of the Island Tourism and Business Community. For over 30 years, Prince Edward Island and visitors have been able to count on Air Canada for year-round and competitive air service connecting the Island with Canada and the world and we are proud to contribute to the success of this important event." 
 "We are very pleased with Air Canada's response to the incremental demand for this summer.  This additional capacity will further increase access to the Island during this important year," said Doug Newson, chief executive officer of Charlottetown Airport Authority.

 "I am extremely pleased to report a strong fourth quarter and a full year net profit for Air Canada of $131 million in 2012," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer. "These results reflect the success of Air Canada's ongoing transformation aligned with strict cost control and disciplined capacity management.  In particular, the strong revenue performance of our international network was led by significant improvements, not only in the Pacific region but also on the Atlantic where we overcame challenges faced by the industry earlier in the year. Our focus remains firmly fixed on further cost reduction and increased revenue generation, including improved yields, positioning us well for the future. 
 "Air Canada marked its 75th anniversary in 2012 by proving it is dynamic and adaptable to an ever-changing industry. In pursuing our global strategy we will continue to build our international network with expanding services to Asia and new routes and destinations such as Istanbul, Venice and Edinburgh. Our commitment to this priority is underscored by our ongoing fleet modernization with the addition of five new Boeing 777s. The further enhancement of our range of international product and service offerings, including the introduction of a Premium Economy product and launch of our leisure carrier Air Canada rougeTM, gives us the tools to more effectively compete in a wider range of international markets. I thank our 27,000 employees for taking care of our customers as recognized by our many awards and accolades throughout the year, culminating in Air Canada recently receiving a Four-Star rating in the Skytrax Airline Star Ranking, the only international network carrier in North America to earn this distinction." 
 Full Year Income Statement Highlights 
 In 2012, system passenger revenues were $10.737 billion, an increase of $529 million or 5.2 per cent, on a 2.6 per cent growth in traffic and a 1.8 per cent improvement in yield. Passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM) increased 3.2 per cent from 2011 due to the yield growth and a 1.1 percentage point improvement in passenger load factor.

 In 2012, operating expenses increased $250 million from 2011, reflecting increases in fuel expense, wages, salaries and benefits expense, capacity purchase costs and other expenses. Partly offsetting these increases was an operating expense reduction of $124 million related to changes to the terms of the ACPA collective agreement pertaining to retirement age and a decrease in depreciation, amortization and impairment expense.

 Adjusted CASM decreased 2.0 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2011, in line with the 2.0 per cent to 3.0 per cent fourth quarter decrease projected in Air Canada's news release dated November 8, 2012.

 Current Outlook 
 In the first quarter of 2013, Air Canada expects its system ASM capacity, as measured by available seat miles (ASMs), to decrease in the range of 0 to 1.5 per cent when compared to the first quarter of 2012. The comparative decrease in capacity in the first quarter of 2013 versus the first quarter of 2012 is due, in large part, to the first quarter of 2012 having had an additional leap year day. 
 Air Canada continues to expect full year 2013 system capacity to increase in the range of 1.5 to 3.0 per cent when compared to the full year 2012.  Air Canada expects its full year 2013 domestic capacity to increase in the range of 0 to 1.5 per cent from the full year 2012. 
 As described in Air Canada's 2012 consolidated financial statements, Air Canada will be required to adopt certain revised and new accounting standards beginning on January 1, 2013, with retroactive restatement of 2012 comparative figures. These revised standards include changes to the accounting for pensions and other employee benefits and changes to the accounting for consolidation. 
 Air Canada continues to evaluate the impact of these standards on its consolidated financial statements however, for the purposes of providing adjusted CASM guidance for 2013, Air Canada has assumed that these standards will result in the following restatements to 2012 operating expenses: 
 The adjusted CASM guidance for the first quarter and full year 2013 are compared to the first quarter and full year 2012, respectively, assuming the adjustments to operating expense noted above. 
 For the first quarter of 2013, Air Canada expects adjusted CASM to increase by 3 to 4 per cent when compared to the first quarter of 2012. For the full year 2013, Air Canada expects adjusted CASM to decrease in the range of 0 to 1.0 per cent from the full year 2012. 
 Air Canada's above-mentioned outlook assumes Canadian GDP growth of 1.5 to 2.0 per cent for 2013. In addition, Air Canada expects that the Canadian dollar will trade, on average, at C$1.00 per U.S. dollar in the first quarter and the full year 2013 and that the price of jet fuel will average 88 cents per litre in the first quarter of 2013 and 89 cents per litre for the full year 2013.

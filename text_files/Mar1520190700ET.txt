MONTREAL, March 15, 2019 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced today that, following Transport Canada's safety notice closing Canadian airspace to Boeing 737 MAX aircraft until further notice, the Federal Aviation Administration's temporary grounding order and Boeing's decision to suspend MAX deliveries to airline customers, it is suspending all financial guidance it provided in respect of the first quarter and full year 2019.
In light of the current uncertainty, Air Canada is suspending all financial guidance it provided on February 15, 2019 and February 28, 2019 in respect of the 2019 financial year. The financial guidance provided for the years 2020 and 2021 with respect to annual EBITDA margin (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment, as a percentage of operating revenue) and annual ROIC (return on invested capital) as well as the cumulative free cash flow over the 2019-2021 period remains in place.

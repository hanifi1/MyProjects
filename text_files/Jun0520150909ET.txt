TORONTO and MONTREAL, June 5, 2015 /CNW/ - Air Canada further expanded its global network with this morning's arrival of AC824 in Amsterdam from Toronto and the departure of AC994 from Montreal to Mexico City. The launch of these non-stop services marks a further advance of the airline's international expansion strategy, which has seen its international capacity grow more than 50 per cent since 2009.
"Air Canada has firmly committed to a strategy of profitable international expansion and these flights are yet further evidence that we are delivering on this promise. The addition of Amsterdam to our global network is being welcomed by customers because the city is both a popular tourist destination and a major business center with longstanding links to Canada. Air Canada is the only Canadian carrier to offer the route year-round and it will complement our existing service to Brussels, providing customers wider access to the Benelux region," said Benjamin Smith, President, Passenger Airlines, at Air Canada. 
"Our new route to Mexico City from Montreal expands upon our current services to the Mexican capital from Toronto-Pearson and Vancouver. As one of the largest cities in the world, Mexico City offers great potential for business and leisure traffic travelling in both directions, which is why we are deploying mainline aircraft with Business Class service. The flights are also conveniently timed for onward connections through our domestic and international network."
New routes launched by Air Canada this year, in addition to Toronto-Amsterdam and Montreal-Mexico City, include: Montreal-Venice, Vancouver-Osaka, Vancouver-Comox, Calgary-Halifax, Calgary-Nanaimo, Toronto-Austin, Toronto-Atlantic City and Calgary-Terrace.  Announced new routes still to launch include: Toronto-Dubai, Toronto-Delhi and Toronto-Abbotsford.

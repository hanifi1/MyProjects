 MONTREAL, April 8, 2013 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada reminds customers that starting April 10, 2013 the domestic cut off check-in and baggage drop off deadline (latest time after which customers can no longer check in or drop off their baggage) will be increased from 30 minutes to 45 minutes before flight departure. The revised minimum domestic cut-off deadline applies to all Air Canada and Air Canada Express flights within Canada, with the exception of flights leaving Toronto Billy Bishop Airport (YTZ) which remains at 20 minutes. With these changes, minimum domestic check-in and baggage drop off deadlines will now be more closely aligned with those of other airlines in Canada. 
 Air Canada continues to recommend that customers arrive at the airport 90 minutes prior to departure of domestic Canada flights in order to ensure plenty of time to check in (if not already done online or on a mobile device), drop off baggage and pass through security.

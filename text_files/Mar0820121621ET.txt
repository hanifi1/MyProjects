 MONTREAL, March 8, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Canada's Minister of Labour, the Hon. Lisa Raitt, has issued a referral pursuant to the Canada Labour Code, to determine the activities that Air Canada may be required to maintain as relates to the health and safety of Canadians. 
 As a result of this CIRB referral, the IAMAW cannot commence a strike and Air Canada cannot lock out its pilots at least until this matter has been determined by the Board. The strike deadline by the IAMAW and Air Canada's lockout notice to ACPA, both originally scheduled for 00:01 am ET on Monday March 12, 2012, have therefore no effect. 
 There will therefore be no disruption of service and Air Canada's full schedule remains unchanged. 
 We thank our customers for their patience and loyalty during this time.  Customers should continue to book with confidence. 
 Air Canada encourages customers to visit aircanada.com for flight information and self service booking tools to avoid longer call centre wait times due to a higher volume of calls than usual. 
 Air Canada will continue to provide updates as developments warrant. 
 The IAMAW represents Air Canada's 8,600 mechanics, baggage handlers and cargo agents. ACPA represents the airline's 3,000 pilots.

MONTREAL, Feb. 5, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada announced today it will launch this summer new, year-round Air Canada rouge services between Hamilton and Calgary and seasonal service between Toronto Pearson and Abbotsford. The non-stop, daily flights will give Canadian travelers more competitively-priced options when flying within Canada.
"Air Canada is very pleased to offer its customers additional options at compelling fares for travel in Canada. Located in the heart of the populous Golden Horseshoe of Southern Ontario, Hamilton is a convenient departure and arrival point for tourists and visiting friends and relatives. This makes it a market ideally-suited for Air Canada rouge with its competitive cost structure," said Benjamin Smith, President of Passenger Airlines, Air Canada. "Since it was launched a year-and-a-half ago, Air Canada rouge has proven popular with leisure travelers in the transborder and international markets. We are now selectively deploying it on a limited number of new domestic routes, such as Toronto-Abbotsford, as part of our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth and to complement our successful mainline domestic network."
The new daily services will begin operating June 27, 2015. Air Canada rouge will operate both routes with Airbus A319 aircraft with 136 seats offering two comfort choices: 12 Premium rouge seats‎ in the front cabin with enhanced service and personal space; and 124 rouge seats in the second cabin. The schedule for these flights is:

 MONTREAL, Feb. 14, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada confirmed it is business as usual for the airline and that its customers can continue to book Air Canada flights with confidence, following the announcement today of voting results by the Air Canada Pilots Association (ACPA) which gave union leadership a strike mandate if a tentative agreement is not reached.  ACPA represents approximately 3,000 pilots employed by Air Canada. 
 "We welcome the Minister's appointment of the Honourable Justice Louise Otis and Mr. Jacques Lessard, Acting Director General - Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, as co-mediators pursuant to Section 105 of the Canada Labour Code.  We are committed to a negotiated settlement with our pilots and look forward to a final resolution to these long-standing negotiations. It is business as usual, and customers can continue to make their travel plans and book with confidence," said Duncan Dee, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.

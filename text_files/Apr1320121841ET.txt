 MONTREAL, April 13, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada is preparing to resume its full flight schedule for Saturday April 14, 2012 following the cancellation of approximately 75 flights on Friday April 13 due to illegal job action taken by some of its pilots.  Cancelled flights were primarily to and from Toronto, the carrier's main hub, and other Canadian or United States destinations.  Air Canada's international flights were not affected. 
 On Friday, the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) granted, at Air Canada's request, an order declaring that certain pilots were participating in an illegal strike; ordering ACPA, the pilots' union, to take all reasonable steps to bring to an end the illegal strike; and requiring all pilots participating in the illegal strike to immediately return to work and perform their duties in the normal manner.  As such, Air Canada expects to resume its normal schedule effective Saturday April 14. 
 "Our first priority today has been to take care of our customers," said Duncan Dee, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. "While we were able to re-accommodate almost all customers affected on alternate flights, we recognize the inconvenience this job action has caused to our customers.  We thank them for their patience and loyalty as we re-double our efforts to restore their confidence in Air Canada.  The vast majority of Air Canada's pilots reported to work today and performed their duties as the true professionals they are.  I would like to thank them and all other Air Canada employees for getting our customers to their destination safely and as quickly as possible." 
 Air Canada operates approximately 600 daily flights.  In addition, the carrier's regional airline affiliates including Jazz operate approximately 900 Air Canada Express flights daily that were not affected by the illegal job action.

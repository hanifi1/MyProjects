MONTREAL, May 1, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - Celebrations are being held at four airports across Canada today as Air Canada inaugurates new services between Vancouver-Osaka, Vancouver-Comox, Calgary-Nanaimo and Calgary-Halifax.
"We have strategically added new leisure services to our international and domestic Canada route network with our leisure carrier Air Canada rouge, and we continue to increase our Air Canada Express services to communities in Western Canada to meet demand. We are very pleased to inaugurate four new routes today including the only non-stop flights from Canada to Osaka which we expect to be particularly popular with Japanese visitors to Canada," said Benjamin Smith, President, Passenger Airlines at Air Canada.
"As Canada's largest airline with the most extensive network for connections, our new Osaka and domestic flights are timed to offer customers more choices and convenience when travelling, as well as the opportunity to accumulate and redeem Aeroplan miles," concluded Mr. Smith.
Up to five times weekly Vancouver-Osaka flights are operated by Air Canada rouge this summer with 280-seat Boeing 767-300ER aircraft offering a choice of premium and economy cabins. Up to ten weekly, seasonal Halifax-Calgary flights are operated by Air Canada rouge with 136-seat Airbus A319 offering a choice of premium and economy cabins.

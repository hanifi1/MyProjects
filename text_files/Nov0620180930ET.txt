MONTREAL, Nov. 6, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada Vacations announced today the launch of its 2019 Canada Collection. Canada's rugged landscapes, cultural attractions and proximity make it a prime destination for travellers looking to enjoy the country's four distinct seasons. Inviting you to discover the Great White North, the refined collection features 91 vacation packages, which include flight and hotel accommodations, options for stays ranging from three to fifteen nights, and the ability to combine two or more regions.
"When we dream about our next vacation, we often think of adventures in far away places," said Nino Montagnese, Managing Director at Air Canada Vacations. "Our goal with our Canada Collection is to highlight our country's charm through well-designed, convenient travel packages that let Canadians experience untamed tundra and city flair found in their own backyard."
From skiing in Banff, grizzly bear viewing in B.C., witnessing the Northern Lights in the Yukon, or tantalizing your taste buds in Toronto or Atlantic Canada, the comprehensive Canada Collection has been enhanced to include ten of the greatest ski resorts in Western Canada and three in Quebec, plus options for non-skiers like snowmobiling, dogsledding and wildlife adventures. It also offers up golfing, camping, cruises and urban getaways as well as Fly &amp; Drive and Fly &amp; Rail vacation options. Packages come with possible inclusions for ski mountain transfers, lift tickets, train tickets or complimentary camping gear, among others.

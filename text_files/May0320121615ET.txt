 MONTREAL, May 3, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - For the month of April, Air Canada reported a system load factor of 83.0 per cent, versus 81.9 per cent in April 2011, an increase of 1.1 percentage points.  System traffic increased 1.0 per cent on a system-wide capacity decrease of 0.3 per cent. Air Canada reports traffic results on a system-wide basis, including regional airlines from which Air Canada purchases capacity. 
 "For the month of April, Air Canada reported a system load factor of 83.0 per cent, an increase of 1.1 percentage points from the previous year," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Overall, traffic grew system wide by 1 per cent, led by traffic growth in our domestic Canada and Pacific markets of 3.3 and 5.1 per cent, respectively.  These gains were achieved despite a reduction in capacity of 0.3 per cent as a result of disruption to operations caused by job action by a number of unionized employees and the rescheduling of maintenance activities following the sudden closure by Aveos of its facilities. We are focused on maintaining the loyalty and confidence of our customers, and I would like to thank those employees who worked doubly hard during the month to get our customers to their destination safely."

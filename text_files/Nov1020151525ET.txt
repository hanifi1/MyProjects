MONTREAL, Nov. 10, 2015 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has been recognized for the third consecutive year as one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" in an annual employer survey by Mediacorp Canada Inc. The national competition for 2016 recognizes employers with exceptional human resources programs and forward-thinking workplace policies after editors conducted a detailed review of company operations and Human Resources practices, including a comparison of others in their industry and region.
"Air Canada is delighted to again be named among the Top 100 Employers in Canada. As we continue on our evolution to being a global champion in our industry, it is important for us to be employee-focused to retain and attract Canada's best and brightest, and this recognition affirms that we are," said Arielle Meloul-Wechsler, Vice President Human Resources at Air Canada. "Air Canada has long been regarded as a progressive employer and on average we receive more than 290 applications for each job we fill."
Mediacorp editors grade employers on eight criteria, which have remained consistent since the project began 16 years ago: physical workplace; work atmosphere &amp; social; health, financial &amp; family benefits; vacation &amp; time-off; employee communications; performance management; training &amp; skills development; and community involvement. The editors publish detailed reasons for selection and grades for these criteria, providing transparency in the choice of winners and a catalogue of best-practices for employers and job-seekers alike. In selecting Air Canada, Mediacorp cited a number of employee programs at the company including the range of in-house training programs available from language, technical and flight training to the company's formal online Air Canada University, and the Air Canada Foundation's charitable work done with children.

 Annual EBITDAR of $1.242 billion and operating income of $179 million 
 MONTREAL, Feb. 9, 2012 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today reported full year operating income of $179 million compared to operating income (before a net reduction of $46 million to a provision for cargo investigations) of $232 million in 2010, a decrease of $53 million. Adjusted net loss per diluted share was $0.72 in 2011 compared to an adjusted net loss per diluted share of $0.58 in 2010. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2011, Air Canada recorded an operating loss of $98 million compared to operating income (before the net reduction to the provision for cargo investigations) of $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, a decrease of $113 million. Air Canada recorded earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment, and aircraft rent ("EBITDAR") of $162 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to EBITDAR (before the net reduction to the provision for cargo investigations) of $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, a decrease of $166 million. 
 "Despite the challenges of 2011, I am pleased to report solid progress advancing the Corporation's stated priorities during the year," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our focus on revenue generation initiatives resulted in eight per cent growth or an increase of $826 million from the previous year and a record revenue performance for the airline, which helped mitigate a fuel expense increase of $723 million. The Cost Transformation Program surpassed its target in annualized revenue gains and cost savings of $530 million, on a run-rate basis, by the end of the third quarter. On-going disciplined capacity management resulted in the second-highest annual load factor in the company's history of 81.6 per cent. Our focus on growing international connecting traffic via our Canadian hubs is paying off, particularly at Toronto Pearson where it has increased by 110 per cent since 2009. 
 "Cost transformation and revenue optimization remain important priorities going forward to support ongoing unit cost reductions and a number of significant business transformation projects are currently being executed. 
 "As we worked to engage our customers, we grew our premium customer traffic, resulting in an increase in premium cabin revenues of 8.3 per cent compared to the previous year. Despite difficult labour negotiations in 2011, our employees remained committed to taking care of customers. We thank our customers for recognizing their skill and professionalism, and the quality of Air Canada's product offering, by ranking Air Canada as Best International Airline in North America for the second consecutive year in the annual Skytrax World Airline Awards survey of international air travellers. 
 "Given the current economic environment, we will continue to manage capacity conservatively and are planning for system ASM capacity growth of no more than 1.5 per cent in 2012. We view participation in the low-cost segment of the leisure market as important for the Corporation, and we are evaluating various models that would allow us to participate in this market segment." 
 Income Statement Highlights 
 System passenger revenues increased $118 million or 5.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2010 on a 2.6 per cent growth in traffic and a 1.9 per cent improvement in yield, excluding a $40 million favourable adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 (which related to the first three quarters of 2010). Fourth quarter 2011 system capacity increased 2.5 per cent when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Premium cabin revenues grew $23 million or 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the same quarter in 2010, due to an 8.2 per cent increase in traffic as premium cabin yield declined 2.2 per cent. Passenger revenue per available seat mile ("RASM") increased 2.0 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to the yield growth. 
 Operating expenses increased $196 million or 8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2010, mainly due to higher base fuel prices year-over-year, an increase in aircraft maintenance expense and the capacity growth. Partially offsetting these increases was a significant reduction in depreciation, amortization and impairment expense. 
 Unit cost in the fourth quarter of 2011, as measured by operating expense per available seat mile ("CASM"), increased 4.9 per cent compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding fuel expense and excluding the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations, CASM decreased 1.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2010. The favourable impact of the capacity growth, the impact of the cost transformation program ("CTP") initiatives, as well as an increase in average stage length compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 contributed to the year-over-year decrease in CASM, excluding fuel expense and excluding the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations. 
 Air Canada reported a net loss of $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, which included foreign exchange gains of $114 million, compared to net income of $89 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which included foreign exchange gains of $136 million, an impairment charge on aircraft of $49 million, and a net favourable adjustment to the provision for cargo investigations of $46 million. 
 For the full year, Air Canada reported a net loss of $249 million in 2011, which included foreign exchange losses of $54 million, compared to a net loss of $24 million in 2010, which included foreign exchange gains of $184 million, an interest expense charge on the repayment of the term credit facility of $54 million, an impairment charge on aircraft of $49 million, and a net favourable adjustment to the provision for cargo investigations of $46 million. 
 Liquidity Highlights 
 At December 31, 2011, Air Canada's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments amounted to $2.099 billion, which represented 18 per cent of 2011 operating revenues. 
 In 2011, free cash flow of $366 million decreased $380 million from 2010, largely due to a decline in net cash from operations, a reduction in cash provided by working capital and an increase in past service pension funding obligations. In 2011, Air Canada made pension funding contributions to its pension plans of $385 million. In 2012, Air Canada expects pension funding contributions to amount to $426 million. 
 At December 31, 2011, adjusted net debt of $4,576 million decreased $298 million from December 31, 2010. Debt repayments of $608 million in 2011 were funded from positive free cash flow of $366 million and the proceeds from new debt borrowings of $232 million. The favourable impact of foreign exchange on aircraft rent also lowered capitalized operating lease obligations by $126 million in 2011. 
 Labour Update 
 On March 18, 2011, Air Canada's pilots rejected a tentative agreement reached between Air Canada and ACPA, the union representing Air Canada's pilots. Since that time, Air Canada recommenced negotiations with ACPA, and while the conciliation timetable is set to expire on February 14, 2012, negotiations are scheduled to continue beyond that date with the assistance of a federally-appointed mediator. 
 Discussions are also on-going with the IAMAW representing the airline's mechanics, baggage handlers and cargo agents assisted by a federally-appointed conciliator. 
 The company is in discussions with CALDA representing the airline's 74 flight dispatchers following rejection, in a ratification vote, of a tentative agreement reached on August 19, 2011. 
 The airline is also in discussions with CAW Local 2002 representing the company's 120 crew schedulers. 
 In 2011, new collective agreements were concluded with the CAW representing Air Canada's call centre and airport customer service agents, CUPE representing the airline's flight attendants and UNITE representing its customer service, aircraft services, cargo and clerical staff in the United Kingdom. 
 Current Outlook 
 In the first quarter of 2012, Air Canada plans to increase its system ASM capacity, as measured by available seat miles (ASMs), by 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent compared to the first quarter of 2011. 
 Air Canada expects its full year 2012 system capacity to increase in the range of 0 to 1.5 per cent when compared to the full year 2011 and its full year 2012 domestic capacity to increase in the range of 0 to 1.5 per cent from the full year 2011. 
 For the first quarter of 2012, Air Canada expects CASM, excluding fuel expense and the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations, to increase by 4 per cent to 5 per cent from the first quarter of 2011, largely reflecting a projected increase in aircraft maintenance expense. 
 Air Canada expects its full year 2012 CASM, excluding fuel expense and excluding the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations, to increase by 1 per cent to 2 per cent from the full year 2011 level. 
 Air Canada's above-mentioned outlook assumes that the Canadian economy will continue to recover and assumes Canadian GDP growth of 1.5 per cent to 2.0 per cent in 2012. In addition, Air Canada expects that the Canadian dollar will trade, on average, at C$1.01 per U.S. dollar in the first quarter of 2012 and C$1.00 per U.S. dollar for the full year 2012 and that the price of jet fuel will average 88 cents per litre for the first quarter of 2012 and 87 cents per litre for the full year 2012.

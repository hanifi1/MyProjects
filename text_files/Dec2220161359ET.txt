MONTREAL, Dec. 22, 2016 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada is offering customers an opportunity to give the gift of travel to someone deserving this holiday season. https://www.facebook.com/aircanada/videos/1285491851498707/ 
Yesterday evening aboard Air Canada's 787 Dreamliner flight AC115 from Toronto to Vancouver, customers were each gifted two round-trip flights to anywhere Air Canada flies. One flight is for the customer to realise a dream and make a positive impact, and the second ticket enables them pay it forward to someone who can make their own mark on the world.

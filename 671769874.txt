MONTREAL, Jan. 30, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada today announced it will begin new domestic regional non-stop flights on July 2, 2018.  Flights are now available for purchase along with introductory promotional fares at aircanada.com, via the Air Canada app and through travel agents. 
"We are pleased to offer new non-stop flights onboard our Bombardier Q400s between popular BC and Alberta cities as we continue to strategically expand our already extensive domestic network," said Benjamin Smith, President, Passenger Airlines at Air Canada. "With the continued growth at several communities on Vancouver Island and in the BC Okanagan, we see the opportunity to add new non-stop services and provide additional convenient travel options."
"With Alberta being such a key market, the new direct flights into Kelowna, Victoria and Comox are great news for British Columbia's visitor economy," said Walt Judas, CEO of the Tourism Industry Association of British Columbia. "Air Canada's commitment to servicing these routes is not only a huge boost for the individual communities, it is also a major benefit for the Thompson Okanagan and Vancouver Island regions as a whole."
"Consistent and convenient air service is vital to connect travelers with new destinations and to entice return visits," added Lisanne Ballantyne, President and CEO of Tourism Kelowna. "These additional routes support the central Okanagan's growing popularity for leisure and business visitors seeking relaxing vacations or a vibrant meetings and event destination. We appreciate the expanded global connections this offers for visitors who want to discover Kelowna's culinary experiences, year-round outdoor adventures, golf getaways, or to attend festivals and events in our lakeside city."
"We are pleased to learn of the additional daily flights between Calgary and Comox. It will give our residents additional connectivity to the rest of Air Canada's world-wide network. Visitors to the Comox Valley will appreciate the convenience of a mid-day flight in providing easy access to the incredible attractions and amenities in the Valley and beyond," stated Mayor Paul Ives, Town of Comox.
"Comox Valley Economic Development and Tourism welcomes this news and thanks Air Canada for recognizing the importance of the Comox Valley Airport as a critical transportation hub on Vancouver Island. This expanded connectivity will support increased visitation, business travel and investment, which in turn supports the economic well-being of the regional economy," added John Watson, Executive Director, Comox Valley Economic Development and Tourism.

 MONTREAL, Feb. 12, 2013 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada is expanding its Lowest Price Guarantee to give customers added assurance they are getting the lowest price available on-line within a 24-hour period when they book flights on Air Canada. The guarantee applies to any destination Air Canada serves for tickets bought in Canada on aircanada.com. 
 "Air Canada's new Lowest Price Guarantee means customers can be certain they will always get the best price for their Air Canada flight at aircanada.com. With the proliferation of travel websites the market can be confusing, so to make it easy for customers and give them confidence they are getting the lowest price available online we are expanding our existing North American fare guarantee to cover our entire global network. Our promise to our customers is that by going to aircanada.com they are guaranteed of always finding the lowest prices for wherever we fly and if they find the same flight elsewhere in Canada at a lower price within 24 hours we will provide a $50 travel credit plus the price difference," said Ben Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Air Canada. 
 Here are the highlights of how our Lowest Price Guarantee works.

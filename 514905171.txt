 MONTREAL, July 7, 2014 /CNW Telbec/ - For the month of June, Air Canada reported a record system load factor of 85.7 per cent, versus 85.0 per cent in June 2013, an increase of 0.7 percentage points on a system-wide capacity increase of 9.8 per cent. On this additional capacity, system wide traffic for June increased 10.6 per cent. Air Canada reports traffic results on a system-wide basis, including Air Canada rougeTM, which began operations on July 1, 2013, and regional airlines from which Air Canada purchases capacity. 
 "I am pleased to report a record load factor of 85.7 per cent for the month of June on an important capacity increase of 9.8% year over year," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "System wide, traffic grew 10.6 per cent, led by the U.S. transborder, Atlantic, Latin American and Caribbean markets. This is the third consecutive month Air Canada has set new records system-wide for passengers boarded, and on June 27 we achieved a new single day record of nearly 138,000 customers. These strong results demonstrate that we are effectively executing on both our international growth plan and on our Air Canada rouge leisure strategy, while we also continue to further strengthen our competitive position. During the month, we successfully moved our London U.K. operations to Heathrow's new Terminal 2 along with other Star Alliance member airlines to provide customers with improved connections and a better travel experience, and on July 1 we inaugurated the only non-stop service between Toronto and Tokyo-Haneda with convenient daytime flights within easy access to downtown Tokyo. I would like to thank our employees for their continued focus on taking good care of our customers and transporting them safely to their destinations."

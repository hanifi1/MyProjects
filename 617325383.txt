MONTREAL, March 28, 2017 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has been named one of Canada's Best Diversity employers for 2017, the second consecutive year the carrier has been awarded this distinction. In naming Air Canada, Mediacorp Canada Inc. cited the airline's success promoting women, including in non-traditional roles. The award is based on Mediacorp's Canada's Top 100 Employers project, which also included Air Canada for the fourth consecutive year for 2017.
"Diversity is a powerful tool in business. Studies show that diverse groups generate greater creativity and innovation. It is also essential for attracting and retaining the best talent because people value inclusion and the receptive environment diversity creates motivates everyone to do their best work. This is a particularly important attribute for a global airline like Air Canada that competes with other international carriers for both customers and talent from around the world," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive of Air Canada.
"We therefore put a tremendous emphasis on diversity. One example is the prominent roles women occupy throughout our company, from the airport ramp to C-suite offices and the Air Canada boardroom. Today, nearly half of Air Canada's employees are women and more than 40 per cent of middle managers are women. We are pleased that Mediacorp has recognized our efforts to attract more women, particularly for non-traditional roles at the airline."
In citing Air Canada, Mediacorp noted the carrier maintains diversity committees across Canada in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. It cited Air Canada's programs to encourage young women to consider aviation careers and noted that Air Canada hired 30 women pilots in 2016, up from 11 in the prior year.

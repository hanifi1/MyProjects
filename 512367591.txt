 MONTREAL, May 3, 2013 /CNW Telbec/ - For the month of April, Air Canada reported a system load factor of 82.1 per cent, versus 83.0 per cent in April 2012, a decrease of 0.9 percentage points.  System traffic decreased 0.2 per cent on a system-wide capacity increase of 1.0 per cent. Air Canada reports traffic results on a system-wide basis, including regional airlines from which Air Canada purchases capacity. 
 "I am pleased to report a strong load factor for the month of April of 82.1 per cent," said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Although just shy of the previous year's near-record system load factor, much of the difference in capacity and traffic from the previous year is attributed to the bulk of Easter travel falling in March this year versus in April 2012, making those year-over-year comparisons less meaningful.  I would like to thank our employees for taking care of our customers and their continued hard work and focus on improving operational performance that is yielding results. For the first quarter, we achieved a 30 per cent year-over-year improvement in On Time Performance and we continue to see on-going improvements."
